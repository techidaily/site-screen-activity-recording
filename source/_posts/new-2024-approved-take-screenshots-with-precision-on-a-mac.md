Wondershare Filmora for Mac supports all formats (including .mov) shot on any digital camera, mobile phone, or camcorder. It also has an extensive list of advanced video editing and screen capture tools, including:

• Convenient, easy-to-use interface  
• Extensive roster of special effects and video editing features, including overlays, filters, and elements  
• Multiple export options, including burn-to-DVD  
• Text & titles editor  
• Advanced audio editing features  
• Music library feature  
• Speed control  
• Picture-in-picture capability, split screen, green screen, tilt-shift, and more

Another point in its favor: Wondershare Filmora for Mac is one of the least expensive options for users who want a robust video editing tool for Mac. Low price combined with ease of use, shallow learning curve, and extensive features makes Filmora a title to watch among the crowded field of all-in-one video capture & editing tools for Mac.
