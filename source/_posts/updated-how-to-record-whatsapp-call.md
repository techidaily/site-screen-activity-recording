## Part 2\. How to Record a WhatsApp Call on Android?

WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app among Android users. WhatsApp has literally replaced text messaging and its free audio call feature is widely used as an alternative to traditional call. At the same time, users prefer WhatsApp video call over audio call for personal communication with contacts. Due to its usage more for personal communication over professional communication, there is no WhatsApp record feature available for security and privacy reason.

That is why you will need an external screen recorder app and we recommend AZ Screen Recorder. The app is free to use and very easy to operate. With a single tap, you can record anything on the screen including WhatsApp call. Here are the steps to follow to record WhatsApp call on Android.

![az screen recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg)

Step 1: Go to Play Store from your Android device and install AZ Screen Recorder app.

Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and the app will provide you with a pop-up overlay bar on the screen.

Step 3: Open WhatsApp and go to the conversation of the person whom you want to video call.

Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder bar, tap on Record icon. You will get 3 seconds of buffer time to start your WhatsApp video call. Thereafter, the app will start recording the screen which is your WhatsApp video call in this case.

Step 5: When you have finished your video call, tap on Stop icon on AZ Screen Recorder bar. The recorded video file will be available in the phone gallery.

## Part 3\. How to Record WhatsApp Video Call on iPhone?

There are two options available for iPhone users depending on iOS version of your iPhone. If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you can use the default screen recorder feature available to record WhatsApp call. However, if your iPhone has iOS lower than 11, you can either update iOS to 11 or use a WhatsApp video call recorder. Otherwise, you can connect your iPhone to Mac, and you can use QuickTime Player to record WhatsApp video call.

Using iOS Inbuilt Screen Recorder -
