## Conclusion

To summarize ShowMore screen recorder review for you, it is an outstanding free online screen recorder without any watermark. However, there is no video editing option available and it is not suitable for recording high-end games. We have suggested better alternatives such as Screencastify online browser extension recorder. The best alternative is Wondershare Filmora where you can record as well as edit video like a pro.
