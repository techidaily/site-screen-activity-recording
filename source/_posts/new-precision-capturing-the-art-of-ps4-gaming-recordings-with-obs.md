## 2\. OBS Alternative To Record Gameplay

There are various reasons why users look for OBS alternative and ready to switch over to a premium software. OBS Studio does not have a clean user interface. Due to loads of features and functionalities, the user interface is complicated and the learning curve is steep.

Besides, many users have reported that OBS crashes when they start to record video games with PS4 connected. Moreover, OBS is not suitable for capturing high-end games as well as for low-configuration system as it requires heavy CPU resource.

As an alternative PS4 OBS is [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You will find many popular video creators using Filmora to [record screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), gameplay, webcam overlay. Besides, it is a professional video editor and you can add video and audio effects, edit as per requirements, and publish an attention-grabbing video on video streaming platforms. Here are the steps you need to take to record gameplay when you are playing on PS4.
