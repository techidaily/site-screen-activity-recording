 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

For many years, computer instructors face the fierce challenge of instructing another user to perform a specific task on their own computer. Things become harder when the user is away from the instructor. In fact, it is far harder than programming or managing a database because in this case, you have to deal with another person with a different mind-set. No matter how hard your efforts are, you will feel tired at the end of the day more likely with less satisfactory output with ordinary instructional methods. As a great alternative for this, you can seek the help of a screen recording software to make the teaching or instructing effective and productive with minimal efforts. There are many [screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software for you to pick when you browse through the internet.
