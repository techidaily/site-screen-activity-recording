The interface that you will get here is highly intuitive and you will not face any sort of hassle while setting up or even recording the screen. There are also many advanced options in terms of customization of the preferred settings. Let's go through the process in the following section.

How to record?

* Launch the app and navigate to the File button on the taskbar. Click on it and go to the Open Capture Device option.
* A new dialog box will appear and it will give you all the options to easily record Mac screen with internal audio. The Capture tab will let you add the webcam footage along with mic input as basic settings.
* We are discussing the screen recording process here so for that you have to change the Input Devices to Screen.
* Now, choose the screen resolution along with the frames per second. By default, the FPS will be set to 5, however, for the screen recording, we would recommend setting it to 30\. If the VLC isn't able to handle it properly, you can set it to 15, as well.
* Make sure that the Capture Audio checkbox is enabled and built-in mic or your external mic is selected. Click on the Settings button for more advanced options.
* Once you have configured everything, it's time to get back to the previous dialog box and hit Open. It will start recording.
* To stop the recording, you will simply need to press the Stop button on the bottom left.

## Conclusion

The methods that we have discussed here are quite simple and you will get some very advanced features for the screen recording tasks. We are seeing a surge in the demand of these apps and it has become an essential tool for those who are remotely working. The tools that we have discussed here are able to answer the question of how to record Mac screen with internal audio and mic input without any hassle. The free tools that come preinstalled are limited in features but the recorded content is in high quality.
