#### 1. WebCam Mania ![Webcam Games](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-webcam-pc-games-play-online-webcam-mania.jpg)

Here is a top-rated collection of various short duration flash games that work online and support webcam-based operations. In order to make your characters do something on the screen, you need to move your limbs, especially arms in a specific direction with exact motion so that desired job can be done. In one part of this game, players need to block the snowballs to defend his snow castle, and it can be done by moving hands in both directions. One more addition to this series is more interesting where the player needs to pop the green bubbles available on the screen while saving the red ones.

You will love the graphics, background music and animations of this game. But note that its ability to sense your limb movements completely depends on the webcam quality. The great news for crazy gamers is that it is a two-player game where his player can have his personal paddle on one portion of the screen.

But you will love the way it adds few unique games in between and allow players to do experiments with advanced photo editing effects and filters.

People love the way developers have merged 3D modeling with this gaming platform while supporting awesome display features.
