### 1. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail

Scheduling a session through Gmail is fairly simple, for this all the user requires is access to a Gmail account and they are good to go. First what one must do is sign into their Gmail account and go to the homepage.

On the left side of their screen, they will see options under the “Meet” heading, one is “New Meeting” and the other is “Join a Meeting”. If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the “New Meeting” option.

Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.

![google meet invitation link on Gmail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gmail-google-meet-invitation-link.jpg)

Over here there are three options. By clicking the “copy link” button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.

If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the “Send Invite” button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.

![share google meet invitation link on Gmail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-meet-invite-link-gmail.jpg)

Upon clicking the “Share Via Email” option, users will be redirected to a new tab where they can see an email pop up and from there, they can invite participants to the session through their email address, as indicated in the image below.

If individuals want to instantly create and start the session, they can click the “Start Now” option, and the meeting will automatically start.

### 2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar

Another way to create a Google Meet session is through the Google Calendar. Much like the process of creating it through Gmail, there are a few steps involved, but the process is very easy.

First individuals must go to the Google Calendar homepage and click the “Create” button.

Fill in the form, if you would like to invite participants to the Google Meet conference, you can also list down their email address in the “Add Guests” section. Once you have done that click the “Add Google Meet Video Conferencing” option.

![add google meet  on google calendar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-google-meet-video-conferencing-calendar.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Create Google Meet on Android/iPhone/iPad?

Google Meet comes with an option for groups to create video conferences on their mobile and tablet devices as well. Whether you are using an Android device or iOS, you can easily create a meeting!

One thing to remember is that in order to create Google Meet sessions through a mobile or tablet device is that one must download the application of Google Meet.

Once the application has been downloaded into your device, open the Google Meet app to its homepage and two options will appear in front of you: “New Meeting '' and “Join With a Code''. To create Google Meet sessions, click the “New Meeting'' option.

Upon clicking that button, three new options will appear:

You can change the date by clicking on the date in the form, then a drop-down menu will appear from which you can choose the required date. Follow the same process for the time as well.
