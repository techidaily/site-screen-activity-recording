After starting out with homebrew games, Yuzu has since expanded by remaking Switch titles currently available for purchase. There's a whole new branch of subtopics that needs to be addressed regarding the morality and legality of purchasing games, but that's not our focus in this article.

Yuzu was the first Switch emulator to be released. From the makers of Citra, one of the most popular 3DS emulators comes this free and open-source emulator. The emulator runs on C++ and is designed to emulate the Nintendo Switch's essential hardware components. function. Some games have problems with this, which is one of the reasons the performance in certain titles is less than ideal.

Despite the lack of power, Yuzu managed to run Super Mario Odyssey at a frame rate comparable to the Switchback in 2019\. There was no sign of lag or missing parts of the background scenery, which is impressive for an emulator. Right from the start, users feel confident about Yuzu. It's clearly designed and provides users with everything they need to know. A list of fully functional games can be found on the site, there are regular updates to let users know what the team is working on, and a handy FAQs section gives users a wealth of troubleshooting advice when any error codes pop up.

Ryujinx is the first multi-platform emulator for the Nintendo Switch with local wireless support. Some games run better on Yuzu and others that work better on Ryujinx.

It contains 1000 games, of which half are considered playable. Ryujinx highlights this information to potential users from the start. They may still have some way to go until it's perfect, but they're at least honest and aware of the obstacles. To deliver a better-than-expected experience, Gdkchan, the team behind the software, is continuously improving the accuracy and performance as well as the user interface and build consistency.

This speedy emulator has very little room for failure, which makes it one of the safest options. Aside from these advantages, the Ryujinx emulator is easy to use and can run games at 60fps. However, even though this emulator is amazing, it is still unable to run commercial Nintendo Switch games which is the only downfall of this emulator. The developers are continuously working on it to make it better. The experience is quite close to console-like, even right on your desktop.
