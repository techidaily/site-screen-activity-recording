Bringing the two Japanese icons Nintendo & Power Rangers, together is a feat to be celebrated. Fans are praising the game's range of heroes from the beloved franchise, with its fast-paced gameplay working well on handheld devices.

Even though the game uses a tag-team mechanic that few others use, its gameplay is just as captivating as the show, despite the occasional shaky sound design. In terms of the use of complicated maneuvers, there are both simple and complex aspects to learn, but fans of the genre and brand should be interested in this game.

**Features:**

• One of the best combat games that you might be missing out

• The game offers dynamic graphics

• Pretty simple controls with easy to learn functionality

### 7.Streets Of Rage 4

![streets-of-rage-4-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streets-of-rage-4-poster.png)

Although the game is available on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation as well, the Switch manages to give players a more immersive experience than those platforms. In this new generation of games, a franchise more than two decades old is brought back to its roots with updated graphics.

Although the mechanics are similar in a way, this is more like a return to a side-scrolling era, while many other titles utilize an arena matchup style of gameplay. Whether it's the intense gameplay itself or the energetic campaign, players will continue to come back to the game.

**Features:**

• Better gameplay experience as compared to other consoles

• Intense gameplay

• One of the best fighting games to play on Switch

More so, the 3D style of gameplay develops in the series, which is quite refreshing in comparison to some of the 2D scroller games. A gripping story and a few unique combos make this a great game for those players who enjoy ongoing campaigns.

**Features:**

• Naruto Lovers will definitely enjoy this game

• Best gameplay

• Extra-Ordinary graphics make it worth playing

While Kirby is likely to appear in Super Smash Bros, why is one enough when there are nearly two dozen? Kirby comes in all kinds of styles, including one called Wrestler and one named Bell. Their gameplay is all different.

A simple title like Kirby Fighters 2 can be enjoyed by families.

Nintendo Switch is lucky to have this classic title, which really celebrates the company and genre.

**Features:**

With this exclusive title from Nintendo, you'll get both a boxing game and a party game. This is an incredibly wacky game in every imaginable sense, with its colorful visuals giving a hint of the fun to be had.

Despite its chaos, it's relatively easy to participate. Fighting arenas in these games are characterized by their enormous boxing gloves and stretching arms, with players facing off in a wide variety of locations, yet somewhat uninspired. As for the balance, other games in the genre suffer from the same frustrations as this one does.

**Features:**

• Convenient controls and simple concept

• It plays easily with little effort

• Younger gamers will enjoy this game because it isn't violent
