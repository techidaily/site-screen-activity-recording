Note

## **Part 2: How to record skype call via mp3 skype recorder?**

Though recordings are fully automatic on this tool however few steps are required to set up the recording to start on its own.

**Step 1**: Make sure the **ON** button is pressed and its green to start automatic recordings.

**Step 2**: Switch off the automatic recording button by selecting the **OFF** button if you are willing to record the calls manually. When the calls are ready to be recorded you can click on the **ON** button to reactivate the recording on the current call.

**Step 3**: As the process is automatic, whenever a call is detected mp3 skype recorder will start on its own and a small indication will be displayed when the recording is started. If you don’t need this alert then you need to buy the pro edition of mp3 skype recorder.

**Step 4**: To check if the recorder is working fine, you can check the recording status on the bottom bar of the recorder window. You will see that the current mp3 size is changing consistently and that indicates that the recorder is getting sound that is being encoded into a file.

**Step 3: Change the recording path**

If you want to change the recording destination then click on the path and choose the folder where you want to save the recordings.

However, the recordings are kept in the user application folder by default as this path is recommended by Microsoft. If by mistake you have selected a different path then you can restore it to default by clicking on **Restore default folder settings** located on the right side of your recorder folder.
