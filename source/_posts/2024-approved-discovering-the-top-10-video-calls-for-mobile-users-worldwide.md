Features:

* Custom sticker making, a gallery and a time capsule feature from your memories
* Direction sharing for easy meetups, mini-programs, and top stories

* They incorporate a healing kit and health tracking data app

Cons:

* Most definitely not the best business video call chat for iPhone.
