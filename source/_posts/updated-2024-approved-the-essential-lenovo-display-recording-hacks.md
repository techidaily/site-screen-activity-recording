Free recording time is restricted to 15 minutes for each video; upgrade to a Deluxe or Premier subscription to get unlimited recording time. Both the free and commercial versions of the screen recorder allow you to record an unlimited number of videos.

Step 4: Save the file as an mp4, AVI, or FLV. Then, on your device, choose a target folder. Click "publish" after giving your video a name so you can locate it later.
