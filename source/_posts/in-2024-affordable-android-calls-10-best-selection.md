WhatsApp features an impressive collection of GIFs and emojis that make all your conversations more entertaining, and you can also use the app to take photos or record voice messages.

Furthermore, you can make group calls with up to 20 participants on Viber, although you must have Viber 10 or a newer version of the app in order to participate in group calls. The ability to send instant voice and video messages or quickly switch between video and audio calls are also the advantages you will have if you choose to install Viber on your Smartphone.

![ FaceTime Alternative:  Line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/line-video-call-chat.jpg)

The fact that Line has 600 million users hints just how popular this cross-platform messaging app really is. In addition to free voice and video call options, Line also enables its users to participate in group calls with up to 200 people. Besides chatting, sending audio and video messages, stickers, or even GPS coordinates, you can also use Line as a social network.

Even though Line can be used for free, you should keep in mind that the app displays ads and offers in-app purchases.

![ FaceTime Alternative: Snapchat  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-video-chat.jpg)

With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.
