### 1\. Add Dissolve Transitions to Video to Fade in and Fade out Video Footage

The first way to fade in and fade out the footage in Filmora is by applying dissolve transition. The dissolve, also called lap dissolve sometimes, is a gradual transition from one image to another. It is often used when the first image starts to disappear and the next image starts to display gradually.

So you can apply Dissolve transition at the beginning of the video from a black screen to fade in, and add dissolve transition at the end of the clip into the blackness to fade out.

Here is how to add dissolve transition in Filmora.

![Add Dissolve to Fade video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dissolve-transtion-filmora9.jpg)

* Drag the Dissolve transition to the beginning part of the clip, and then drag the Dissolve transition again to the end of the clip.

Besides applying Dissolve transition to fade video, you can also try the Fade or transitions under Ripple & Dissolve category such as Dispersion blur, evaporate, ripple, wind, swirl, or wave.

### 1\. Add Dissolve Transitions to Video to Fade in and Fade out Video Footage

The first way to fade in and fade out the footage in Filmora is by applying dissolve transition. The dissolve, also called lap dissolve sometimes, is a gradual transition from one image to another. It is often used when the first image starts to disappear and the next image starts to display gradually.

So you can apply Dissolve transition at the beginning of the video from a black screen to fade in, and add dissolve transition at the end of the clip into the blackness to fade out.

Here is how to add dissolve transition in Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* After importing video footage into Filmora, drag and drop them in the timeline.
* Go to the Transition tab and find Dissolve under the Basic category. If you didn’t see it, you can use the search bar to find it.

![Add Dissolve to Fade video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dissolve-transtion-filmora9.jpg)

* Drag the Dissolve transition to the beginning part of the clip, and then drag the Dissolve transition again to the end of the clip.

Besides applying Dissolve transition to fade video, you can also try the Fade or transitions under Ripple & Dissolve category such as Dispersion blur, evaporate, ripple, wind, swirl, or wave.
