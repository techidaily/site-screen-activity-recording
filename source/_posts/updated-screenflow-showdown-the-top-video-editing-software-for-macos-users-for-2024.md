## ScreenFlow Showdown: The Top Video Editing Software for macOS Users

ScreenFlow is a great Mac software for screencasting and video editing. It records your activities on your desktop screen, which you can subsequently modify by editing and rearranging the information, as well as adding callouts, notes, and motion to the recordings. You'll undoubtedly get the job done with a layered timeline and lots of features you won't find in a typical video editor. ScreenFlow is a program that allows you to record your screen as well as edit videos. The program was created for Mac rather than Windows. If you're a Windows user, you'll need to find another means to get to the programs.

The software is perfect for individuals who wish to create professional-looking films for instructional or promotional reasons. Teachers may utilize ScreenFlow to screencast short how-to movies that will improve classroom engagement. For their goods, marketing experts may make an explanation video or lesson. YouTubers and bloggers can create a professional video that engages their viewers in a matter of minutes. The user may transition between screens with a single click of a button thanks to ScreenFlow. It also permits recording from a mobile device by simply putting the device onto a USB port and selecting the Record IOS Device option. Of course, the option is also readily accessible from the main menu.

## 1\. Stunning Features of ScreenFlow

**User-Interface Design:**

With a sleek user interface, an easy-to-use video editing and screen recording program built exclusively for MacBook users. There are also a plethora of other transition effects, all of which are labeled to make them easy to identify. Other video editing software names transition effects in such a confused manner that it creates a lot of stress throughout the editing process.

**Display Resolution:**

To work smoothly and correctly with a macOS authorized graphics card for Apple MacBook, it demands high-resolution.

**Input/Output Formats Accepted:**

This software input formats need an external thunderbolt GPU in Capture devices.

**Feature for Editing:**

This program allows for video editing, as well as comments and drawing tools, as well as screen recording. The editing interface is also quite user-friendly. For video pictures and audio, there is a timeline, which is identical to most other user-friendly editing tools.

**User Interaction**:

Good ratings on the App Store, as well as millions of macOS users worldwide, prove that this software utility provides a very satisfactory user experience.

**Features for exporting:**

It offers a direct YouTube upload option that enables you to directly publish your modified video to your YouTube channel. All of the video effects may be found in the upper right corner. Text and videos may be added, as well as audio and video attributes, video effects, and more.

## 2\. How to Use ScreenFlow

Step 1.Setup and User Interface:

ScreenFlow will want to be relocated to your programs folder when you initially download it. The intro screen appears once everything is up and running. You may produce new media by capturing your screen and/or microphone by selecting "New Recording." You may also start a new blank document or open one that you're currently working on. Whatever path you choose, you'll ultimately arrive at this location:

![setup and user interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-and-user-interface.jpg)

Step 2.Media & Screen Recording:

ScreenFlow can record your desktop or any iOS device connected to your computer through the lightning connection, which is particularly useful for Apple enthusiasts who may need to show a mobile function during a video. This function was not accessible to me since I have an Android phone. ScreenFlow's main function is a screen recording, and the application is particularly good at capturing video. You'll be provided with a dialog box for capture settings such as source and audio choices when you select to start a new screen recording.

![media and screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-and-screen-recording.jpg)

Step 3.Turn Off the Recorder:

You'll be instantly transferred to a new document (or the one you were working on) once you complete the recording and your recording will appear in the timeline and media resource panel. The media tab, which is located on the right-hand editing panel, contains any video clips you've uploaded, audio from iTunes or your PC, and a copy of your screen recordings.

### iMovie

Consider utilizing an iMovie player if you don't have any advanced screen recording or editing requirements. It's free and comes standard with Mac OS, but you won't have access to sophisticated editing, annotations, or filters. iMovie is ideal for quickly capturing your screen or producing recordings that need no (or little) editing. Simply launch iMovie and choose File > New Screen Recording from the File menu. In addition, when your film is ready for a big release, you may see it in iMovie Theater on all of your devices. Explore your video collection, share your favorite moments, and create high-quality movies with resolutions up to 4K. You can even start altering videos on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

You may rotate, divide, and cut your movies, and you can add clips after a recording if you wish to combine the screen recording with another reference. Only MOV files may be exported; otherwise, you'll need to use a video converter.

### Final Cut Pro

For Mac users, Final Cut Pro is the most direct rival of ScreenFlow. For the last two years, we've been utilizing Final Cut Pro for Mac. Final Cut Pro has a very low learning curve: it's really simple to use. It also has a simple ScreenFlow solution that enables you to swiftly move material from phones and tablets to the software. If you want to make movies on the web and share them with friends or family, Final Cut Pro is another easy-to-use and easy-to-learn video editor for casual users. It's possibly the most affordable commercial video editor available. One thing we don't like about the application is that it lacks screen recording capabilities, which many of its rivals possess.

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-cut-pro.jpg)

Final Cut Pro is an excellent piece of software for producing high-quality films, television programs, and advertisements. You may pick from a variety of video effects, titling choices, and movie templates in the software. It also has 4K and motion tracking capabilities. It isn't the most user-friendly video editor, though, since it lacks import and organizing options. Final Cut Pro is aimed towards all PC users, the same as ScreenFlow is. Final Cut Pro14, the most recent version, fits clearly in the upper echelon of video editors. Many amateurs may be put off by the price, but if you want to make professional-looking movies for commercial usage, you get what you paid for.

Features:

* Make a video instruction or record gameplay.
* Add lines, numbers, and text to your recording as you go.
* Add a watermark, edit, or trim your video to make it seem better.
* Trim the video's beginning and finish.
* Record the whole screen or a rectangular region; the area immediately around the mouse; or drag and modify to get the precise image you want.
* External devices, such as a smartphone or a camera, may be recorded.
