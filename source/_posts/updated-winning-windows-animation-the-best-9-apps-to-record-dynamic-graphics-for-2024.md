Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

However, there aren't that many screen recorders for Windows OS that let you save screen recordings as GIF files, and for that reason, we've composed the list of best **GIF Recorders** for PCs. Let's have a look at some of the most powerful software products for creating animated GIFs on Windows.

## Best GIF Recorders to Capture Animated GIFs on Windows

Here are the 8 best recorders to have gifs for you to look at.

Fraps is probably one of the oldest screen recorders for gaming because it was released 18 years ago, and besides providing video capture features, it can also be used for benchmarking or displaying frame rates.

Fraps don't offer support for GIF files, which means that you can only use it to create an MP.4 or AVI file that you can later convert to GIF file format. Capturing videos and still frames outside of a video game is not on the list of options the software offers.

When you want to stop recording, click on the Save button and choose the destination on your hard drive where the file will be saved.

#### 6. [ShareX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility** **:** Windows 7 or later

![sharex gif recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sharex-capture-screen-recording-option.jpg)

ShareX also offers photo editing features, but it doesn't provide any video editing options, so making adjustments to the GIF you create with this application requires you to use another program.

**Price:** Free version available, Pricing starts at $3,99 billed annually

**Compatibility** **:** Windows, Mac, iOS, Android...

![Gyazo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gyazo.jpg)

Creating a GIF file with Gyazo is a straightforward process that takes a minimum amount of time and effort.
