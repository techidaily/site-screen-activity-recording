## Conclusion

If you want to record your gameplay on your computer when you play with PS4, you need a video recorder. OBS Studio is a default choice and we have stated how to go for OBS studio PS4 in simple steps even though OBS’s user interface is complicated to use. If you want to capture gameplay while you play on your TV, you will need a capture card. If you are looking for OBS alternative, we recommend Wondershare Filmora where you can record and edit video like a pro.
