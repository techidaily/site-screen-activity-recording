## PC's Top Choice: Essential PS1 Emulators

Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001\. The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo's SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.

With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.
