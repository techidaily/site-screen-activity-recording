Adding a virtual background on Google Meet is a fairly simple task. Here’s how!

Important: Note that if you are entering the meeting without logging into your Google account, and if you require a knock to get admitted into the meeting, you will not be able to use this feature. Also, users who join Google Workspace for educational meetings, can not select their virtual backgrounds for Google Meet.

First, open the Google Meet session and enter into the meeting. At the bottom of your window click on the 3-dots option and click the “Apply visual effects” option from there.

![Google Meet change  background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-visual-effects-option-google-meet.jpg)

However, if you want to add your own virtual background from your device then click “Add”.
