 **How do I record a stream on Spotify?**

The only way to record a stream on Spotify is by using a Spotify recorder. If you are using Spotify on your smartphone, you will need Spotify recorder Android and iOS, respectively.

**Does Spotify let you screen record?**

No, Spotify does not let you screen record. This is because if they allow screen record, the recordings will get distributed across the world for free. Spotify holds the license for distribution and free distribute will hurt the business. Therefore, Spotify offers no option for screen recording. However, premium Spotify users can download any track and listen offline only through Spotify.

 **How do I record a stream on Spotify?**

The only way to record a stream on Spotify is by using a Spotify recorder. If you are using Spotify on your smartphone, you will need Spotify recorder Android and iOS, respectively. If you are using Spotify on your computer, you will need Spotify recorder Windows and Mac, respectively. Once you have installed Spotify audio recorder, you need to get the settings perfect on the application and hit the Record button.

The Bottom Line

There is no option available to record a stream on Spotify. If you are a premium Spotify user, you can download them to listen to them offline.
