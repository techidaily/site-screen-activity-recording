 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

With the COVID restrictions, many people are working from home. But how to communicate with colleagues far away?

Because of technological developments, people can connect with each other easily. One of the most convenient weapons that helped bridge the gap is Google Meet.

However, not everyone is excited that coworkers can directly peek into the room. Is there any way to **blur the background on Google Meetings**? In this article, I will show you how to use the blur background feature in Google Meet.

* [Part 1: Blur the Background in Google Meet Before Video Call on Laptop](#part1)
* [Part 2: Blur the Background in Google Meet Before Video Call on Mobile](#part2)
* [Part 3: Blur the Background in Google Meet During Video Call on Laptop](#part3)
* [Part 4: Blur the Background During Video Call on Google Meet Mobile App](#part4)
* [Part 5: Best Free Google Meet Background Blur Extensions](#part5)

## Part 1: How to Blur the Background in Google Meet Before Video Call on Windows/Mac/Chromebook?

It is always better to be prepared for a meeting beforehand. However, because of the lack of time or morning blues, you did not clean your room and are hesitant to share your screen you can use the blurred background features.

After starting the Google Meet meeting or entering the password, you can see yourself on the screen. On the bottom right corner, there should appear a silhouette for Windows users. While for Mac users, there will appear three dots. Move the pointer on the silhouette icon or three vertical dots to view the options.

Google Meet provides its users with three major fun and convenient options for blurred background Google Meet.

* When you click the silhouette with large dots, you can completely blur the background for Google Meet.
* On clicking the silhouette with smaller dots, you have the choice to partially and slightly blur the background for Google Meet. Therefore, you may not look completely photo edited or creepy, in other words.
* Alternatively, you can choose a funky or decent background. Google Meet allows you to upload your own photo from the laptop and use it as background as well.

Primarily there is no difference while blurring the background in Google Meet for android or Mac users; the background blurring option typically rolls out when you have the recent compatible software installed. The most recent version of Chrome is recommended for Windows users, whereas Safari for Mac users.

## Part 2: How to Blur the Background in Google Meet Before Video Call on iPhone/Android Phone?

Online meetings have made our lives easier. We could be traveling and take a business call with the help of our iPhone or Android anywhere. There is, however, a minor restriction when it comes to a phone; we cannot choose any background. With mobile, we have only two options to blur the background for Google Meet. Completely blur or slightly blur.

There will always be glitches and malfunctions in the technical realm, which can usually resolve by restarting the software or device. However, minimum compatibility requirements must be present if you wish to avail blurred background features for Google Meet on your iPhone or Android.

You need to be having an Android phone with a minimum 9.0 version. For iPhone users, 6s is the minimum requirement for iOS. In addition, your Android smartphone should have 3 GB RAM, ARM64, 4 CPU cores, 1.6 GHz CPU clock. The majority of typical phones support all of the stated features. So, do not be concerned if you do not grasp all of the technical jargon. Just search the model of your mobile phone online and compare to find out.

## Part 3: How to Blur the Background in Google Meet During Video Call on a Laptop?

The process to blur the background in Google Meet during a video call is quite similar for Windows and Mac users. You can access three vertical dots on the bottom of the self-view Google Meet screen. Click on the three vertical dots, and a pop-up window option will appear. Click on the concerned option to change the background.

![Blur background  on Google Meet video call](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-change-background-during-call.jpg)

You can click on the silhouette with large dots to completely blur the background, or one with the small dots to obscure slightly. You can also click on the Plus symbol to add any picture and use it as your background on Google Meet. The feature does not only benefit lazy people, but it can often make your session fun and interactive.
