## Part 5\. The Best AZ Screen Recorder Alternatives For PC And Mac

Like AZ Screen Video Recorder, there are many other mobile applications offering screen recording functionalities. However, these apps cannot compete with their desktop counterparts that come with more robust features and controls.

Following are the reasons why you might want to consider using a desktop recorder:

**Larger Recording Areas:** Mobile devices have small screens, so you are limited to selecting the area of a screen to record. However, this is not the case with desktop recorders which offers more area and even allow you to set a custom section of the screen for recording.

**Video Editing**: Unlike mobile apps, many desktop screen recording software programs also offer basic video editing capabilities, such as trimming, adding annotations, and more.

**More Features:** In general, desktop screen recording applications have more features than their mobile counterparts.

With that being discussed, we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \- a one-of-its-kind software that has many powerful capabilities, such as screen recording, video editing, speed ramping, royalty-free library, and more.

Here’s how you can use Filmora software to record a screen or webcam on a PC or Mac:
