To stand out in the vast internet market, a videographer does not always have the luxury of filming in the ideal setting. Using software-based simulation, which replaces the actual video backdrop with the required one chroma-keying, is a simple solution to this problem. Remove the video's backdrop using one of three methods available to you.
