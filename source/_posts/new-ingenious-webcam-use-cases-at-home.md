#### 3. Use for Home Surveillance

Everyone wants additional security in the living premises and public places as well.

The surprising fact is that these webcams can even record infrared light movements that are otherwise invisible to human eyes. Hence, they are the best solution for night time monitoring.

You will be happy to hear that internet is loaded with so many impressive games that are played with sensor-based controls.
