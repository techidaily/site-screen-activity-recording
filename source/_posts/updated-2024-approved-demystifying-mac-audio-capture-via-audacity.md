## Demystifying Mac Audio Capture via Audacity

Meta: Looking for a free software to record and edit audio on Mac? Audacity is a great choice. Learn how to record audio with Audacity on Mac.

Are you looking for a free application for your Mac where you can record your audio and edit it as per requirements? Audacity is a popular choice among Mac users, especially among musicians who work with multi-track audio. In fact, even podcasters with limited budget prefer Audacity Mac for its advanced editing options.

Audacity is a free and open-source application. It is quite advanced in its features even though it is completely free to download and use. That is why not just beginners but professionals prefer it over other premium audio recorders and editors. However, Audacity is slightly complicated to operate. In this article, we will illustrate how to use Audacity on Mac and recommend a better alternative.

## 1\. How to download and install Audacity on Mac?

Downloading and installing Audacity macOS is not as simple as any other application. You can blame Audacity Developers for making it complicated for Mac users. You can either download the application from the official website or from their download partner – FossHub. Here are the steps to download and install Audacity Macbook and iMac.

Step 1: Visit [Audacity Download](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/mac/) page.

 Step 2: It should download Audacity DMG file automatically. However, if it does not, click on “Audacity (version) dmg file” on the Download website.
