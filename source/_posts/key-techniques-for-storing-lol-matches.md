The user interface is not as easy as other gameplay recorders but here is how to record LOL games with OBS Studio.

Step 1: Download and install OBS Studio for free.

Step 2: Open OBS Studio and click on “+” icon from Sources tab. From the menu, select Game Capture option.

## Way 3\. Record LOL Games with Windows Game Bar
