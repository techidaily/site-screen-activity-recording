Wondershare Filmora has enhanced the user’s free will by letting him take control of the video quality and frame frequency. The user can decide if the microphone has to be switched on or off in the process. Not only this, one can rely on Filmora to insert the expected closure time of the video recording.

After that, the screen recording stops automatically. There is a mouse clicks option that is displayed during the video recording. Filmora offers a different design of the mouse display and lets you choose if you need the click sound. The Pause/Resume hotkey and Start/Stop hotkey can also be tailored to user needs.

In short, it would be hard to find a screen recorder that takes all the user’s needs under consideration. After the settings have been updated and the recording is done, the tool saves the video automatically to the library.

The user can access the video from there and make necessary changes to it. The changes can be as slight as altering the brightness or saturation of the video and as massive as cropping, trimming, or adding effects to it.
