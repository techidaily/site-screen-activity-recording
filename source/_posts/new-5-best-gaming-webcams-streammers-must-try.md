 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

[Streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video games are more popular than ever. The star of the most-followed channel on Twitch makes more than $560,000 a month streaming. If you are looking to get in on the action you need to pick up the best gaming [webcam](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your budget. However, there is a lot to consider before choosing your camera.

This guide critiques and ranks the best gaming webcams to make that choice easier. Some webcams provide great value, while others deliver an unbelievable high-resolution streaming experience. The following are some of the features we looked for in creating this guide:

## What to Look for in Gaming Webcams

* Video quality
* Resolution
* Microphone quality
* Price
* Low-light capabilities

## Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have

* 1080p resolution
* 60FPS
* Stereo Audio
* Ergonomic design
* RealSense capabilities
* Automatic light correction
* Compatibility with both Windows and Mac

So, without further ado, the following are our 5 favorite webcams for gaming in 2021:

#### 1. Ontop+ HD Webcam

![Ontop Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ontop-webcam.jpg)

The [Ontop+ HD Webcam](https://www.amazon.com/Microphones-Facial-enhancement-Technology-Recording-Streaming/dp/B074D2K7CZ) is a fantastic entry-level camera. It has a **6-element glass lens** and delivers **1080p at an admirable 30 FPS**. It also has **automatic low-light correction**, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.

Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and [Twitch](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The wide-angle view also gives you impressive **80-degree panoramic views**.

Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With **built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones**, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.

**Pros:**

* Price
* 1080p HD streaming
* Wide-angle viewing lens
* Optimised for YouTube and Twitch

**Cons:**

* Audio quality
* Average Amazon rating

#### 2. Logitech BRIO

![Logitech Brio 4K Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-brio-4k-webcam.jpg)

The Logitech BRIO is the best high-end webcam for streaming. It delivers tremendous **4K Ultra HD recording**, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).

The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as **5x digital zoom**, **facial recognition** and **omnidirectional mics**. It also supports **Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR** which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.

For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.

**Pros:**

* 4K Ultra HD recording
* Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR
* Fantastic audio

**Cons:**

* Price
* Compatibility

#### 3. Razer Kiyo

![Razer Kiyo Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kiyo-webcam.jpg)

The [Kiyo](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?field-keywords=Razer%20Kiyo%20-%20Full%20HD%201080P%20Streaming%20Camera%20-%20Pro%20Webcam%20Optimized%20for%20Youtube%2FTwitch%20-%20Worlds%20First%20In-Built%20Ring%20Light&tag=puregamingnet-21) is an innovative new web camera. The **ring-light camera** is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with **12 different brightness settings,** so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.

What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting **1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)** and **1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)** like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.

**Pros:**

* Built-in Ring Light
* 1080p HD streaming
* Built for Twitch streamers

**Cons:**

* Audio quality
* No additional features
* Cost

#### 4. AUKEY FHD Webcam

![AUKEY Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aukey-webcam.jpg)

Aukey has built a decent-quality camera for a low price. With **1080p full HD video at 30 FPS**, on a **2-megapixel base** and **built-in stereo microphones**, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.

What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has **no additional software to install**, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.

Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.

**Pros:**

* 1080p HD streaming
* Cost
* Ease of use

**Cons:**

* No lighting correction features
* No 60 FPS streaming

#### 5. Razer Stargazer

The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an **Intel RealSense 3D camera**, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.

However, the [Intel RealSense camera](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?%5Fga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897) limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don't require.

Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams **1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)** and **1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).** With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have **fantastic colour accuracy**. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it's **fantastic at filtering out ambient noise**.

If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at **[only $150 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M)**.

**Pros:**

* Incredible background removal technology
* Great audio
* Cost

**Cons:**

* Not as good video quality as some of its competitors
* Not compatible with older generation computers

Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list. The Kiyo has cutting-edge lighting technology and the Stargazer, with Intel RealSense, has the best background removal technology we have seen.

![Filmora logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png) ![filmora product interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png)

### The All-in-One Screen Recorder & Video Editor

* Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously
* Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools
* Built-in plentiful templates and effects
* Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

![secure download](https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg)Secure Download

For those with the budget to invest in a serious piece of equipment, we would recommend the BRIO and the Stargazer, depending upon your computer’s processor. At the other end of the scale, the Ontop+ and AUKEY are great options for entry-level streamers working on a budget.

Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have **fantastic colour accuracy**. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it's **fantastic at filtering out ambient noise**.

If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at **[only $150 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M)**.

**Pros:**

* Incredible background removal technology
* Great audio
* Cost

**Cons:**

* Not as good video quality as some of its competitors
* Not compatible with older generation computers

Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list. The Kiyo has cutting-edge lighting technology and the Stargazer, with Intel RealSense, has the best background removal technology we have seen.

For those with the budget to invest in a serious piece of equipment, we would recommend the BRIO and the Stargazer, depending upon your computer’s processor. At the other end of the scale, the Ontop+ and AUKEY are great options for entry-level streamers working on a budget.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

[Streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video games are more popular than ever. The star of the most-followed channel on Twitch makes more than $560,000 a month streaming. If you are looking to get in on the action you need to pick up the best gaming [webcam](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your budget. However, there is a lot to consider before choosing your camera.

This guide critiques and ranks the best gaming webcams to make that choice easier. Some webcams provide great value, while others deliver an unbelievable high-resolution streaming experience. The following are some of the features we looked for in creating this guide:

## What to Look for in Gaming Webcams

* Video quality
* Resolution
* Microphone quality
* Price
* Low-light capabilities

## Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have

* 1080p resolution
* 60FPS
* Stereo Audio
* Ergonomic design
* RealSense capabilities
* Automatic light correction
* Compatibility with both Windows and Mac

So, without further ado, the following are our 5 favorite webcams for gaming in 2021:

#### 1. Ontop+ HD Webcam

![Ontop Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ontop-webcam.jpg)

The [Ontop+ HD Webcam](https://www.amazon.com/Microphones-Facial-enhancement-Technology-Recording-Streaming/dp/B074D2K7CZ) is a fantastic entry-level camera. It has a **6-element glass lens** and delivers **1080p at an admirable 30 FPS**. It also has **automatic low-light correction**, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.

Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and [Twitch](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The wide-angle view also gives you impressive **80-degree panoramic views**.

Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With **built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones**, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.

**Pros:**

* Price
* 1080p HD streaming
* Wide-angle viewing lens
* Optimised for YouTube and Twitch

**Cons:**

* Audio quality
* Average Amazon rating

#### 2. Logitech BRIO

![Logitech Brio 4K Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-brio-4k-webcam.jpg)

The Logitech BRIO is the best high-end webcam for streaming. It delivers tremendous **4K Ultra HD recording**, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).

The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as **5x digital zoom**, **facial recognition** and **omnidirectional mics**. It also supports **Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR** which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.

For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.

**Pros:**

* 4K Ultra HD recording
* Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR
* Fantastic audio

**Cons:**

* Price
* Compatibility

#### 3. Razer Kiyo

![Razer Kiyo Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kiyo-webcam.jpg)

The [Kiyo](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?field-keywords=Razer%20Kiyo%20-%20Full%20HD%201080P%20Streaming%20Camera%20-%20Pro%20Webcam%20Optimized%20for%20Youtube%2FTwitch%20-%20Worlds%20First%20In-Built%20Ring%20Light&tag=puregamingnet-21) is an innovative new web camera. The **ring-light camera** is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with **12 different brightness settings,** so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.

What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting **1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)** and **1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)** like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.

**Pros:**

* Built-in Ring Light
* 1080p HD streaming
* Built for Twitch streamers

**Cons:**

* Audio quality
* No additional features
* Cost

#### 4. AUKEY FHD Webcam

![AUKEY Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aukey-webcam.jpg)

Aukey has built a decent-quality camera for a low price. With **1080p full HD video at 30 FPS**, on a **2-megapixel base** and **built-in stereo microphones**, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.

What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has **no additional software to install**, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.

Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.

**Pros:**

* 1080p HD streaming
* Cost
* Ease of use

**Cons:**

* No lighting correction features
* No 60 FPS streaming

#### 5. Razer Stargazer

The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an **Intel RealSense 3D camera**, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.

However, the [Intel RealSense camera](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?%5Fga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897) limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don't require.

Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams **1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)** and **1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).** With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have **fantastic colour accuracy**. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it's **fantastic at filtering out ambient noise**.

If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at **[only $150 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M)**.

**Pros:**

* Incredible background removal technology
* Great audio
* Cost

**Cons:**

* Not as good video quality as some of its competitors
* Not compatible with older generation computers
