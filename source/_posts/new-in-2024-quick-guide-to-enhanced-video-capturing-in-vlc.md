### [QuickTime](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

You may or may well not know that Mac’s built-in QuickTime Player can do screen recording. A person can also modify your screencast. You can also add text, transitions, use zoom, and more. This player can also access films from the iCloud drive, effectively allowing you to view your online collection everywhere.

QuickTime is an excellent player, as long as you are not concerned about additional formats. MP4 is the most typical video type, and thus, most videos you’ll find will be compatible with QT. QuickTime Professional is able to create screen songs, edit clips and convert them to music form. However, QuickTime is restricted in other regards – for example, it has no superior music controls.

### [CamStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

CamStudio is one of the top alternatives to VLC. It has an easy-to-use user interface, less file crowding, and low ram memory consumption. Being a professional, you can save a simple 100 dollars by using CamStudio freeware, and it is number one right now. Yet, CamStudio isn't the only competitor on the market, fortunately. Some of the features fell brief in CamStudio. Functions such as reflexing and frame rate optimization. Versatility in video formats and capturing the display in real-time are also not present.
