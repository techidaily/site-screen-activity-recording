![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Remote collaboration is rapidly changing the landscape of the business world, as the days when attending meetings in person was a necessity seem to be behind us. [Video conferencing platforms](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) often limit the maximum number of participants in a meeting or the meeting’s duration in the free trial version, which is the reason why companies are opting for **screen sharing software.**

Although screen sharing apps are predominately used by customer support professionals to resolve technical issues remotely, these software products are also commonly used for collaboration and communication purposes.

In the previous article, we’ve covered [video conferencing programs that offer screen sharing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) features, so in this article, we are going to take a closer look at some of the **best free screen sharing software**  products you can use from a web browser or a computer.

* [Part 1: 4 Free Online Screen Sharing Software](#online%5Fscreen%5Fsharing%5Fsoftware)
* [Part 2: 6 Free Desktop Screen Sharing Software \[Windows/Mac\]](#desktop%5Fscreen%5Fsharing%5Fsoftware%5Fmac%5Fwindows)

## Part 1: The Best Free Online Screen Sharing Software

Finding a **web-based screen sharing application**  is relatively easy as there are so many different options available. However, you should only use these services if the nature of the information you’re planning to share isn’t sensitive. We recommend choosing a trustworthy screen sharing software to all businesses that value the privacy of their data. With that being said, let’s take a look at some of the best free online screen sharing software products.

### 1\. [Dead Simple Screen Sharing](https://deadsimplescreensharing.com/)

**Price:** Free, $18.00 per month

All you have to do in order to share a screen with the platform is click on the Share Your Screen button on the home page. You won’t even have to create an account on Dead Simple Screen Sharing if you want to create a meeting, but you’ll have to **install the extension**  for your web browser to enable the screen sharing feature.

![Invite People in Dead Simple Screen Sharing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/invite-participants-to-screen-sharing-in-dead-simple-screen-sharing.jpg)

The free version of the app supports both **audio and video conferencing** , but it limits the maximum number of participants to just four. In addition, the platform enables multiple users to share screens simultaneously, while the chat feature is also available. Upgrading to the Dead Simple Screen Sharing’s Pro plan will enable you to host meetings that have up to 150 participants or share screens at high [frame rates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

**Pros**

* Excellent integration options
* Offers scheduling features
* Supports screen sharing at high frame rates
* Equipped with both audio and video conferencing tools

**Cons**

* Only works with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
* The free version of the app limits the maximum number of participants in a meeting

### 2\. [Screenleap](https://www.screenleap.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $19.00 per month

Sharing a screen with Screenleap is remarkably easy, because you just have to click on the **Share Screen Now**  button, and then choose if you want to share the entire screen, an application window or a Chrome tab. Afterward, you can choose if you want to enable the camera and proceed to send the join link to the participants.

<a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
However, you cannot host more than two meetings per day if you choose the free version of Screenleap. Moreover, a single meeting can have a maximum of eight viewers and you can only host meetings for forty minutes per day.

Sharing the controls with the viewers is not possible on the free version of this app. Screenleap allows you to share your screen from any device, but you should keep in mind that this web-based application is only compatible with the Google Chrome browser.

**Pros**

* Allows users to select the area of the screen they want to share
* Quick meeting setup
* Offers SSL encryption protection
* No previous experience with screen sharing required

**Cons**

* The maximum duration of meetings is limited to 40 minutes per day
* Recording a meeting is not possible

### 3\. [Whereby](https://whereby.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $9.99 per month

Whereby is basically a video conferencing application that allows hosts and participants of a meeting to share their screens. However, the free version of this web-based app offers only a limited set of options, because you can’t host a meeting that has more than four participants.

![Whereby Pricing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whereby-screen-sharing-plan.jpg)

You can access Whereby from computers and mobile devices that have Opera, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome web browser installed. Screen sharing is available on both free and paid versions of the app, although you won’t be able to designate the area of the screen you would like to share.

![ Screen Sharing in Whereby](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whereby-screen-sharing-interface.jpg)

The YouTube integration enables you to play any video hosted on this platform during a meeting, but Trello or Google Drive integrations are only available if you purchase a subscription. What’s more, you have to buy the Business subscription model if you want to [record your meetings](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or create personal and team rooms.

**Pros**

* Compatible with Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Google Chrome web browsers
* Allows users to create custom links for meeting rooms
* The simple screen sharing process
* The duration of a meeting is not limited

**Cons**

* Creating more than one meeting room with the free version of Whereby is not an option
* No audio conferencing features

Note: If you want to record the screen in Whereby screen sharing, you can also try some [free meeting recorders](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/)

**Price:** Free

In case you are using Google Chrome as your primary web browser, then you can install the Chrome Remote Desktop extension that enables you to access a Smartphone or a computer remotely. You just have to sign in to your Google account to install the extension, and you can insert a computer’s name and PIN in order to access it. Needless to say, Chrome Remote Desktop must be installed on the device you want to access and the device you’re using to access it.

However, transferring files, hosting or [scheduling a video meeting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is not on the list of options this screen sharing application offers. Even so, Chrome Remote Desktop is a safe and reliable solution for anyone in need of a free and easy way of sharing a screen or accessing a device remotely.

**Pros**

* Quick installation process
* No lagging between two devices
* Secure access to devices
* Available to all Internet users

**Cons**

* No file transfer
* Lacks collaboration tools

## Part 2: The Best Free Screen Sharing Software for Macs and PCs

Organizations whose demands exceed the limits of web-based screen sharing software should consider desktop-based solutions as they are equipped with a broader spectrum of screen sharing and collaboration tools.

Even though most screen sharing services can be used for free, you must purchase a subscription if you want to gain access to all the features they have to offer. Here are some of the best free screen sharing software for PCs and Macs you can find on the market.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png" border="0">Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file/data, even permanently deleted data.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/products/teamviewer/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $33.00 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Android, iOS

With more than 400,000 daily downloads and over 2 billion connected devices, TeamViewer is currently one of the most popular screen sharing software products. A brief look at the list of features TeamViewer offers will leave you wondering if there is anything this software cannot do. Besides remote device control, this screen sharing software enables you to connect to UHD devices, create channel groups or print documents remotely.

The number of devices you can manage with TeamViewer depends on the subscription plan you have, although you can’t manage more than 500 devices even if you purchase the version of the software that is aimed at large teams.

Furthermore, the maximum number of meeting participants and licensed users also depends on the subscription model you choose. The screen share feature can support any device that is compatible with TeamViewer.

**Pros**

* Offers cross-platform access
* Grants users complete control over a remote device
* Powerful screen sharing capabilities
* Keeps all confidential documents secure

**Cons**

* More expensive than other screen sharing software products
* Not aimed at inexperienced users

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. [Mikogo](https://www.mikogo.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $14.00 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, web

Voice conferencing, multi-user [whiteboard](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or session schedulers are just a few among numerous collaboration tools this software offers. Besides viewing a meeting from the desktop client, you can also use the Mikogo app for Android or iOS to take part in a meeting.

The screen sharing features enable you to choose the application window you want to share, while the multi-monitor feature can display up to four screens at the same time.

In addition, you can record your VoIP calls, preview them in the Session Player and decide if you want to convert them to video. The software allows users to send files that can have up to 200MB or exchange instant chat messages.

The Standard pricing plan only supports sessions that have one participant, and you must get either the Professional or Team subscription model if you want to host meetings that have up to 25 participants.

**Pros**

* Makes scheduling sessions easy
* Equipped with a broad range of collaboration tools
* Allows users to choose the application window they want to share
* Offers the switch presenter feature

**Cons**

* Ill-suited for large meetings that have more than 25 participants
* Transferring files larger than 200MB is not possible

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. [join.me](https://www.join.me/)

**Price:** Free trial available, pricing plans start at $10 per month

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, iOS, Android

This video conferencing platform allows all of its users to share their screens with a single click. All you need to do is click on the Broadcast button once the meeting starts and the participants will be able to see all actions you perform on your computer.

Besides the video conferencing features, Join.Me is also equipped with audio conferencing tools that enable you to call local conference numbers in more than fifty countries, mute a particular speaker or switch between active speakers.

This screen sharing software lets you create custom links for your meetings or even change the meeting’s background. Whiteboarding features are designed to enhance the collaboration between the participants by offering an unlimited amount of space where ideas can be written down. The best part is that Join.Me allows you to share your screen with up to 250 people.

**Pros**

* Great video and audio conferencing capabilities
* Effortless scheduling process
* Screen sharing is available within all subscription models
* Powerful collaboration tools

**Cons**

* Me doesn’t have a free version
* Recording options are not available within all subscription plans

### 4\. [ShowMyPC](https://showmypc.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $14.00 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, Linux, macOS

The software’s capabilities or its interface are far from being impressive. The outdated design makes ShowMyPC confusing to use, while the Remote Support and Meetings service offers only basic collaboration tools. Even though sharing a screen with ShowMyPC doesn’t require much effort, you will probably be better of using some other app to share your computer’s screen.

The participants of the meetings you host with this screen sharing software cannot do much else other than view the presenter’s screen. Chatting, file-sharing or recording meetings is not possible, while the maximum number of concurrent meetings depends on the subscription plan you choose. Moreover, there are no audio conferencing options to speak of, which narrows down your conferencing options. ShowMyPC is only a good choice if you are looking for software that lets you share a screen or access a computer remotely.

**Pros**

* Easy access to home and office computers
* Invitation links are generated automatically
* Offers whiteboarding features
* The duration of a meeting is not limited

**Cons**

* No video recording options
* Poor selection of collaboration tools

### 5\. [VNC Connect](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $3.34

**Compatibility:** Windows, Linux, macOS

VNC Connect is a remote access software that allows you to use your mouse and keyboard to control a remote computer. The app doesn’t limit the number of connecting users, and it allows you to chat, transfer files or print documents on different devices. The VNC Connect is equipped with a streaming technology that makes watching videos, CAD modeling, and web browsing much faster.

The devices are connected through cloud connectivity regardless of where they are, and you can access computers from mobile devices and vice versa. All of your sessions are protected by the 256-bit AES session encryption which makes them entirely secure, so that you don’t have to worry about the safety of your data. However, VNC Connect is not aimed at businesses that want to share screens during meetings, but rather towards organizations that want to control multiple devices remotely.

**Pros**

* Intuitive remote control of different devices
* Built-in high-speed streaming technology
* Supports cloud and direct connections
* Multi-factor authentication

**Cons**

* No video conferencing options
* Users need previous experience using similar software products

### 6\. [AnyDesk](https://anydesk.com/en)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $9.00 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Android, Linux, iOS, Chrome OS, Raspberry Pi

If you are looking for software that allows you to access computers remotely and collaborate with team members at the same time, then AnyDesk is the right choice for you. This screen sharing software enables you to access different devices regardless of how far from them you are. AnyDesk has a minimum amount of latency, which means that there will be almost no lagging between two devices.

![Invite People in Dead Simple Screen Sharing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/anydesk-screen-sharing-remote-control.jpg)

The software is also equipped with collaboration tools that allow you to host online meetings, work on a document with your colleagues or hold a presentation. Moreover, AnyDesk has built-in file transfer features so that you can easily share large files with other members of your team. What’s more the software displays images at 60 fps on local networks and nearly all types of internet connections.

**Pros**

* Lightweight and easy to install
* Offers on-screen whiteboard
* Quick and easy file transfer

## Tips for Better Screen Sharing

Ensuring that the virtual collaboration runs smoothly can impact the course of an entire meeting, which is why it is important to avoid making mistakes that can disrupt the flow of a meeting. Here are a few screen sharing tips that will help you increase your productivity during a video conference.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Disable desktop notifications

A private message or any other desktop notification can distract the participants, and for that reason, it is better to switch off desktop notifications while hosting a meeting during which you are planning to share your computer’s screen.

### 2\. Don’t open programs you are not going to use and choose the screen you want to share

A messy desktop can only bring confusion into a meeting since participants can have a tough time focusing on just one application window. Close all programs and documents you are not going to need while sharing your screen in order to create a neatly organized working environment.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Check the presentation before sharing it

Go through a presentation you are going to be sharing with the participants of a meeting before the meeting starts. That way you are going to familiarize yourself with the contents of the presentation and check if some vital piece of information is missing.

**Conclusion**

Screen sharing is an online collaboration tool that can only become more important as a growing number of businesses embrace video conferencing platforms. Software products like Screenleap, Join.Me or AnyDesk make sharing a screen or accessing a computer remotely look easy. Which of the best free screen sharing software products are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.
