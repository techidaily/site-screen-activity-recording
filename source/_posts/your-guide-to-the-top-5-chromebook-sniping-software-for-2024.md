## Your Guide to the Top 5 Chromebook Sniping Software

Using a snipping tool is simple and can be done on a computer, a laptop, or any device capable of using it. It's similar to taking a screenshot on a computer when the Print Screen option is available. You can crop out the unwanted parts by snipping out the part of the image you want from the screen.

When taking screenshots, a Chromebook may be a little different from a Windows or Mac computer. Whether you use the native method or a third-party tool, the process is the same.

It's easy to grab any area of the screen using the keyboard commands, whether it's the entire screen or just a portion. Nonetheless, if this method does not meet your needs, you can find a suitable third-party alternative. This article will show you how you can take screenshots using the keyboard shortcuts on a Chromebook. Furthermore, we will also discuss some of the best Chromebook snipping tools that you can use to get the job done.

## **Best Snipping Tools Chromebook**

Using keyboard shortcuts is the easiest way to take a screenshot of your Chromebook screen.

By pressing CTRL+Window Switch (Show Windows), you can capture your Chromebook's entire screen. Holding CTRL+Shift and pressing the Window Switch (Show Windows) key, select the area you want to capture, then drag the crosshair icon from the trackpad.

Use the stylus with your Chromebook to take full or partial screenshots and annotate, or use the Power+Volume Down buttons to snap a quick screenshot. Even though Chromebook's snipping tool is a bit lacking, there are a number of Chrome extensions and apps that can improve it. Check out the list below.

### 1.LightShot

Chromebook users can use LightShot for free, and Windows and Mac users can use it too. With it, you can take, edit, and upload screenshots to the server as a Chrome extension or as a program.

The screenshot you took can also be copied to the clipboard by selecting any part of the page you want to capture.

You can take screenshots of your entire screen or a portion of your screen with ShareX, crop them on the spot, or store them in your camera roll for further editing later. With the Chrome Extension, you can take many types of screenshots, make animated GIFs while capturing your screen, and share them anywhere you wish.

There are plenty of reasons to like ShareX, even if it's overkill for many users. There are multiple capture methods, such as choosing specific regions, windows, monitors, and different shapes to capture the desired area. A screenshot can also be edited by cropping, pixelating, adding text, or adding shapes with the software. The snippets can also be copied, uploaded, watermarked, and shared on more than 30 destinations via a shortened link. Besides recording your screen, ShareX also allows you to create GIFs.
