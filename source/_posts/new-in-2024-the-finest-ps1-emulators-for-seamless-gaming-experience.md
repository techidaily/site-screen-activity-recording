![matsu-emulator-ps1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png)

There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX/PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.

**Features:**

* It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.
* The sound quality is excellent.
* As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.
* Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.

### 3.Mednafen

![mednafen-poster-ps1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png)

Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator. Users can remap hotkeys and virtual system inputs to joysticks or keyboards, or both simultaneously. Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.

The majority of Mednafen's cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier. For example, MedLaunch offers a dynamic games library with DAT lookup and online scraping and the ability to configure controllers.

**Features:**

* Multi-platform emulation allows games to be played on PlayStation One as well as other gaming consoles.
* Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.
* Providing you have the right PlayStation BIOS and ROM, it can be set up quickly and easily.
* The Mednafen emulator supports the use of game cheats.

It is just a matter of copying the BIOS file from your console, setting up the controller, and customizing the keys.
