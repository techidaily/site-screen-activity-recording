[Awesome Screenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-screen/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj?hl=en) is a service that works via Google Chrome and is very much one of the top rated screen capture & image annotation tools available to the public.

They have done something for their user base in the form of removing all in-app purchases and making all features including those that were previously premium features. Free for all to use on Windows 8.

Due to the fact that it is a Google Chrome extension it is for capturing web pages - any part of a web page at that. From comments and annotations, to blurring sensitive information it can all be done with extension.
