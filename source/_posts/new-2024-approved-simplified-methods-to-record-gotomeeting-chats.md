## Part 1\. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder

Meetings can be recorded using the built-in **gotomeeting recording** option, but there are limits.

However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting's meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.

Step 1\. Just click over the "REC" icon at the top of the GoToMeeting screen once you have joined a meeting to record.

![gotomeeting start record](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-start-record.jpg)

Step 2\. While recording, click "Start Your Recording," and the "REC" icon will become red. The recording of the meeting will be announced to all participants.

Step 3\. Click over the "REC" icon and choose "Stop Your Recording" to stop the recording. If you're making a local recording, the Recording Manager will open up and ask you to convert the video. However, if you're doing a cloud recording, you'll be sent to your online account to retrieve the footage. It takes some time for new recordings to appear in the cloud recording history.

Step 4\. However, what if other participants, such as not account owners or organizers, wish to record live sessions? In this instance, you'll need a video-recording program that works on both PCs and Macs.
