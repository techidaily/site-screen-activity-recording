## Way 2\. How to Screen Record on PS4 via PC

In most cases, your gameplay is likely to go beyond an hour, and hence, PS4 inbuilt screen recorder may not be useful for you. If you want to record your gameplay for more than an hour, you have to use [screen recorder software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on your computer. We recommend Wondershare Filmora to record your gameplay with your audio.

In fact, there are some capture cards that have inbuilt screen recorder. Here are the steps to follow for gameplay recording PS4 using Capture card.

Step 1: Connect PS4, capture card and your computer through HDMI cable.

Step 2: The USB or data cable should go from Capture card to your computer. The PS4 should be connected to your TV.

Step 3: Turn on PS4 and go to Settings on your TV screen. From Settings, go to System> System Information to check if PS4 software is updated. This is to ensure that what you see on your TV screen should also be on your laptop.
