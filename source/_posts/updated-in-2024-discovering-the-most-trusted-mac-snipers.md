## Discovering the Most Trusted Mac Snipers

Screenshots have become so ubiquitous that we don't pay much attention to them anymore. Yet, we use them day-in and day-out to show, explain, and communicate. Screenshots help us enrich and liven up our daily communication, whether it's sharing an image of a software bug with customer support, sending a quick how-to GIF to a colleague, or writing a heartfelt joke to a loved one.

Many Mac users need a widely-rated, multi-use MacBook snipping tool.
