Since webinars are live online events, you cannot watch them again if you do not record the webinars.

Recording a webinar is useful to understand any concept that you could not understand when it was getting broadcast. If you cannot be present all the time to attend the webinar, you can record the webinar and check it out later. In fact, you can share the recorded webinar with anyone at any time.

## Part 3\. How to Record Webinar on iPhone

If you are attending any webinar from your iPhone, you can go for free record webinar without installing any third-party app. This is because iOS 11 and above comes with a built-in screen recorder through which you can record anything on your iPhone screen. You can find the screen recorder on the Control Center. If it is not available, you have to go to Settings> Control Center > Screen Recording and turn on the screen recorder option. Here are the steps on how to record webinar on iPhone.

Step 2: Pull down Control Centre on your iPhone. Tap on Screen Recording option.

Step 3: From the pop-up message, tap on Start Recording option to start recording. Make sure you turn off the microphone.

Step 4: When you want to stop recording, tap on the Red icon at the top-left corner.

## Part 4\. Record Webinar on Android Phones

Unlike iPhone, most Android phones do not have a built-in screen recorder. That is why you have to install an external screen recorder app to record webinar for free. However, you have to be careful while choosing an external screen recorder because some of them could be spyware app. We recommend Mobizen screen recorder app which comes with all the required features and necessary security. The app does not save the recorded video on their servers but only on the user's device. There is no signing up required as you can record your screen instantly. Here are the steps on how to record webinar for free with Mobizen screen recorder.

Step 2: Launch the app and you will see Mobizen recording widget on your screen.

Step 3: Open the webinar that you want to record. Tap on Video Camera icon from the widget to start recording.

Step 4: To stop recording, tap on Stop button and you will find the recorded video on your phone gallery.

## Part 5\. Online Webinar Recording

We prefer Apowersoft free online recorder as it is a trusted recorder and it has all the required features completely. Here are the steps on how to record webinar online.
