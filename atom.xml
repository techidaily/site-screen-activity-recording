Webcams are commonly used during screen recording sessions, to capture the footage of the narrator, but a simple mistake like, not paying attention to the video’s background can ruin a perfectly captured webcam video.</p><p>Besides removing the messy backgrounds, you can also add templates or custom made backgrounds to webcam videos if you would like to hide private information, put the accent on the narrator of the video or improve its overall quality.

Currently, Personify ChromaCam is available <strong>only on the Windows operating system,</strong> so Mac users can’t install the software even if they own a Logitech C992 Pro Stream webcam and BRIO 4K Pro Webcam. If you purchased these webcam models, you will be asked if you want to install the Personify ChromaCam software for free when you connect the webcam to a computer for the first time.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download the software from the ChromaCam<a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/download/" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you are not using the Logitech C922 or BRIO 4K webcam. ChromaCam works with all 2D webcams, but you may need to pay.</p><p>The software’s tech specs are not demanding, but you’ll still need to have <strong>at least Windows 7,</strong> or a more recent version of the Windows OS installed on your PC as well as an Intel or AMD Processor and <strong>4GB of RAM memory.</strong> ChromaCam is <strong>optimized for 64-bit Windows,</strong> although it can work on 32-bit version of the OS, and the software can only be used with processors included in the Intel AVX Set. Personify ChromaCam is compatible with a lot of video chatting apps and broadcasting software products, including Skype, OBS Studio, <a class="link"   href="https://www.xsplit.com/" >XSplit Broadcaster software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (we will take it for example in this article) , Google Hangouts, GameShow or Twitch, to mention a few.</p><p>Regardless of the software, you’re using with ChromaCam, the setup process is fairly simple and it includes only a few easy steps. We are going to show how you can replace and remove backgrounds with Personify ChromaCam using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam" >Logitech C922 Pro Stream <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> webcam.</p><h4 id="Step-1-–-Download-Install-ChromaCam-software"><a href="#Step-1-–-Download-Install-ChromaCam-software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 – Download &amp; Install ChromaCam software"></a>Step 1 – Download &amp; Install ChromaCam software</h4><p>Connect the webcam to your PC, and install the ChromaCam software.

The background removal and replacement features the ChromaCam offers enable users to combine several sources of videos while broadcasting live on the Internet's most popular video streaming platforms.<p>The free version of ChromaCam adds watermarks to all videos, and you must pay a $29,99 one-time fee to remove them. However, the free version of the software that comes bundled with Logitech C922 Pro Stream webcam doesn’t create watermarks.</p><p>When the ChromaCam software is successfully installed on your PC, and after you’ve made sure that the webcam is working properly, you can launch the XSplit Broadcaster. If you haven’t installed this software on your PC yet, you can click <a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/#about" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to start the installation process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/personify-chromacam-remove-background.jpg"                      alt="personify-chromacam-remove-background "                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Setting-up-a-new-recording-session"><a href="#Step-2-Setting-up-a-new-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Setting up a new recording session"></a>Step 2 - Setting up a new recording session</h4><p>Once the XSplit software opens, you should head to the <strong>Add Source</strong> menu, and then select the Personify ChormaCam from the Webcam, capture card, video devices drop-down list. The Personify window will pop-up on the screen, and you’ll be able to select a new background for the webcam video by clicking on the templates featured in the Personify window.</p><p>If you’d like to adjust the video recording settings, you should right-click on the C922 Pro Stream webcam and open the Configure drop-down menu. Select the Video Output feature, and proceed to pick the Color Space Compression, Frame Rato or the Output size. The Video Input option in the Configure menu, grants you access to Logitech’s Camera Settings for the webcam and enables you to activate the Low Light Compensation feature, that improves the C922 Pro Stream’s performance in low-light conditions.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Selecting-the-background-removal-and-replacement-options"><a href="#Step-3-Selecting-the-background-removal-and-replacement-options" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 - Selecting the background removal and replacement options"></a>Step 3 - Selecting the background removal and replacement options</h4><p>In the ChromaCam window, you can select a transparent background option if you would like to blend the figure into the screen recording or some of the template backgrounds that make the narrator stand out against the background. The software allows you to import custom made backgrounds by clicking on the plus icon in the Personify ChromaCam window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromacam-interface.jpg"                      alt="chromacam-interface "                ></p><p>Making sure that the figure in the webcam video is properly cropped is the most important part of the process because badly cropped videos reveal too much of the previous background. The software’s cropping precision is limited, although the Personify ChromaCam provides tools that make the figure’s edges smoother.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Recording-with-ChromaCam"><a href="#Step-4-Recording-with-ChromaCam" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 - Recording with ChromaCam"></a>Step 4 - Recording with ChromaCam</h4><p>Before you start a new broadcast or a screen recording by clicking on their icons on the XSplit’s top bar, make sure that you are properly positioned and that the webcam is directed towards you. The Personify ChromaCam focuses on the head and torso of the figure in the video, so try not to move too much. The new background cuts out the parts of the figure that go out into the area of the background that has been replaced or removed, which can produce an awkward visual effect</p><p>You can pause or stop recording with a single click and all you’ll be able to find your videos in the XSplit’s Recordings tab.</p><p>You can also use this software in other screen recording software, please share with us how it works for you in the comment below.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-better-background-replacement"><a href="#Tips-for-better-background-replacement" class="headerlink" title="Tips for better background replacement"></a>Tips for better background replacement</h2><p>Changing or removing the background in a webcam video is easy, but there a few things you can do to ensure that all webcam videos created with Personify ChromaCam software meet the highest visual standards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1\. Use simple monochrome backgrounds<p>Complex backgrounds that contain a lot of details should be avoided at all cost because the software won’t know which part of the screen you want to replace. A minimalistic, clean working background that doesn’t contain anything that might distract the viewer or the software, will make it easier for the software to place an outline around the figure and separate it from the rest of the image.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-right-balance-between-the-performance-and-video-quality"><a href="#2-Find-the-right-balance-between-the-performance-and-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

Find the right balance between the performance and video quality</h3><p>Logitech C922 can capture videos at 60 fps in 720p resolution when used with Personify ChromaCam, but the software also enables you to reduce the screen recording quality you’re producing and increase the quality of the webcam footage. Click on the Setting icon in the Personify window and then just drag the Performance VS Quality slider to improve the quality of the footage produced by ChromaCam. However, lowering the video quality will also decrease the frame rate, so your screen recordings may not be as smooth as they would be if they were captured at the maximum resolution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834903">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834903">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834903%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834903/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 3\. Use professional lighting equipment<p>Logitech C922 webcam performs remarkably well, even under difficult light conditions, but having enough light in the shot will guarantee that the video meets the conventional quality standards. Webcam videos captured under low-light conditions are often blurry and the person featured in the video is hard to recognize. That’s the reason why you should always strive to have a sufficient amount of light in the webcam video, so the ChromaCam software can easily place an outline around the figure in the video. Using more than one spotlight to light the scene can help you remove the shadows cast by a Persona in the video because shadows can make the background removal software less efficient.</p><p><img

This could only be done by jailbreaking the device or installing a third-party <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder</strong>.</p><p>Another alternative was to connect your device to a Mac and use QuickTime to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen. This can be also troublesome as you can not carry a Mac along with you if you need to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>But all this has changed with the outcome of iOS 11. Apple has added a built-in mobile screen recorder. With the <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad built-in screen recorder</strong>, you no longer need to jailbreak your device or install third-party screen recorders.</p><p>So, in this article, we will show you how to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen whether your iOS device is running the latest iOS 11 and later versions or not.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Use QuickTime to record iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]"></a>Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]</h2><p> The iOS 11 has come with a built-in mobile screen recording feature, so if you’re running the iOS 11 and later iOS versions, you can use the free recording tool of iPhone directly. This built-in app has provided a great alternative to the traditional methods to record screen videos without the use of third-party apps for iOS users.

It means your device will stop functioning and you will need to go to Apple care for getting it fixed. Jailbreaking also voids your warranty. So rather than going through these risks, people preferred using QuickTime to record their Phone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>With QuickTime media player you could record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s Screen.

To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.<p>8. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.</p><p>The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it.

The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms.

A number of great development studios were closing, and even mainstream series like Need for Speed struggled to maintain their original popularity.</p><p>If you are a racing fan, then there is good news for you. Things are a lot better today as compared to the past. Several racing titles have been introduced over the years, like Forza Horizon, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, etc. We have seen several open-world racing games getting immense popularity among gamers. The simulation racing genre is more competitive than ever today. In July 2015, EA acquired Codemasters for a staggering $1.2 billion, illustrating how highly racing games have been valued for the last few years.</p><p>This article will present our top picks of the best sim racing games you can play right now. Most of these games are modern because this genre is continuously improving. But, we won’t be skipping those classic titles that are still popular among gamers and as good as modern ones. Our primary focus here will be to cover those games that are easy to find and play on the majority of the hardware.

The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics.

Unless Twitch streamers enable Video on Demand, the live stream will not be accessible to the viewers later. However, it is quite possible that you cannot watch a live stream completely because you are occupied with other important works, and that is when you can record Twitch stream so that you can watch it later whenever you have time.</p><p>Even Twitch streamers may want to record their own live streams so that they can upload them on other video streaming and social media platforms. Apart from enabling VOD on Twitch by the streamers, you can record Twitch with a professional screen recorder. In this article, we have illustrated how to record Twitch streams on Windows PC and Mac easily.</p><p>Way 1. <a href="#part1">Save Video with VOD on Twitch</a></p><p>Way 2. <a href="#part2">How to Record Twitch Stream on Windows</a></p><p>Way 3. <a href="#part3">Record Twitch with OBS Studio</a></p><p>Way 4. <a href="#part4">Record Twitch Stream with XSplit</a></p><p>Way 4. <a href="#part4">Record Twitch Lice Stream on Mac</a></p><h2 id="Way-1-Save-Video-with-VOD-on-Twitch"><a href="#Way-1-Save-Video-with-VOD-on-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Way 1.

If a Twitch streamer enables VOD, his live stream will be saved for the streamer to watch it and upload it on his channel for his viewers to watch any time after the live stream gets over.

Here are the steps to save Twitch live streams by enabling VOD.</p><p>Step 1: Log into your Twitch account and go to Creator Dashboard.

The link you’ve created by recording the web conference or a training doesn’t change if you edit a video, which means that you can edit a single video in Adobe Connect as many times as you want.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Launch-the-video-editor"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-the-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Launch the video editor"></a>Step 1 - Launch the video editor</h4><p>When the video recording session is over, you should click on the Meeting or Training option on the software’s homepage. Proceed to select the classroom or the meeting that contains the video you just recorded. Afterward, you should click on the Recordings option, and then select the Edit Recording feature in the Actions pop-up menu.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Editing-the-video"><a href="#Step-2-Editing-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Editing the video"></a>Step 2 - Editing the video</h4><p>The software’s video editor will appear on the screen, and you’ll be able to see the toolbar that enables you to play the video or cut the unwanted parts of the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-connect-edit-video.jpg"                      alt=" Adobe Connect Record Meeting "                ></p><p>Click on the Play button to preview the video or use the progress marker to jump to a desired spot in the video. You can also use the progress marker to designate the place in the video where you want to make a cut, and then simply click on the Cut icon that looks like a pair of scissors. The Adobe Connect’s video editor also enables you to control the volume level by clicking on the audio icon on the right side of the editor’s toolbar.</p><p>If you make a mistake during the video editing process, you can use the Undo button to correct it. When you remove all the unwanted parts of the video, click on the Save button to conclude the video editing session.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Adobe Connect is one of the best software products for the creation of eLearning content and video presentations currently available on the market.

Netflix is a streaming service that allows you to subscribe and view movies and TV episodes on your internet-connected devices. With over 222 million customers by the start of 2022, Netflix is likely one of the most popular video streaming services. Netflix will never be boring you with its vast selection of fascinating TV episodes and movies, including action, thrillers, and comedies. This is why Netflix has become everyone’s favorite and we can’t get enough of it. Netflix does, however, have certain limits.</p><p>When you go on a vacation and don’t have access to Wi-Fi, you can have trouble viewing your subscription program when it airs. When it comes to screen recording Netflix, there’s always the issue of whether or not it’s legal. In most cases, the term “illegal” is used to denote a criminal law infringement. Recording and viewing copyrighted works for personal use rather than commercial objectives is not deemed a copyright violation, according to the regulation. You won’t be able to view Netflix when your membership expires. Although Netflix allows you to download some movies with tiles, they may be withdrawn from the Netflix channel before you begin binge viewing.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Netflix"><a href="#Method-1-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Netflix" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use QuickTime to Record Netflix"></a>Method 1: Use QuickTime to Record Netflix</h2><p>You may use the QuickTime Player to record Netflix episodes on your Mac. It’s a built-in multimedia player that can also be used as a screen recorder on almost any Mac. In reality, this program can capture your screen in full-HD (1080p) resolution. It also enables users to utilize hotkeys during capturing to make pausing, restarting, and stopping the recording process simpler. QuickTime Player is a built-in media player for Mac OS X that allows you to watch videos on your computer. With its screen recording capability, Mac users may easily use it as a YouTube video recorder. In addition to video recording, Mac users may utilize the microphone to capture speech or audio.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135394/19272" target="_top" id="2135394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135394/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### **Steps to Record Netflix with QuickTime**<p>We’ll walk you through how to record Netflix using QuickTime in the steps below.</p><p> Step 1: Launch QuickTime Recorder</p><p>QuickTime is a great way to start recording Netflix.

Netflix has added a download function that enables you to save TV shows to your smartphone for offline watching. However, the capability is not available for desktop users, and what’s more, these downloads expire as well. So that’s how simple it is to record Netflix videos. Netflix movies may be recorded in a variety of file formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI, 3GP, and others.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1516822341?pt=169436&ct=pc-article-top50&mt=8"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images2022/download-mac-store.png"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-Netflix-with-Filmora-–-The-Easiest-Solution-1"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-Netflix-with-Filmora-–-The-Easiest-Solution-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Record Netflix with Filmora – The Easiest Solution"></a>Steps to Record Netflix with Filmora – The Easiest Solution</h3><p> 1.

Netflix has added a download function that enables you to save TV shows to your smartphone for offline watching. However, the capability is not available for desktop users, and what’s more, these downloads expire as well. So that’s how simple it is to record Netflix videos. Netflix movies may be recorded in a variety of file formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI, 3GP, and others.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1516822341?pt=169436&ct=pc-article-top50&mt=8"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images2022/download-mac-store.png"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135365/19272" target="_top" id="2135365">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135365" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135365/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Steps to Record Netflix with Filmora – The Easiest Solution<p> 1.

Netflix has added a download function that enables you to save TV shows to your smartphone for offline watching. However, the capability is not available for desktop users, and what’s more, these downloads expire as well. So that’s how simple it is to record Netflix videos. Netflix movies may be recorded in a variety of file formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI, 3GP, and others.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-irecorder-pro-in-depth-analysis/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved IRecorder Pro In-Depth Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-selecting-the-top-6-mac-video-capture-software/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Selecting the Top 6 Mac Video Capture Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-arena-aces-unbeatable-10-royale-games/"><u>[New] Arena Aces Unbeatable 10 Royale Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-awaitingnewagecameratechnologies-for-2024/"><u>[New] AwaitingNewAgeCameraTechnologies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-strategic-mastery-pinpointing-top-7-total-war-battles/"><u>[New] Strategic Mastery Pinpointing Top 7 Total War Battles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-what-is-a-watermark-how-to-watermark-your-facebook-photosvideos-for-2024/"><u>[New] What Is a Watermark?

If you want to record your screen for professional reasons, then this is a great option. It gives you a trial that limits what you can do, but gives you enough of a taste of the app so that you understand it. With this, you can start to learn how it works. It is not that complicated so this part should not take long. It works and it offers what it promises. The only downside is that it will cost you money. If you are looking for something free or cheap, this is not what you want. The developers are aiming for the professionals that want to spend money.<p>Overall, it is okay.

With it, you can take all of the screenshots that you want to take. Whether you are making a scrapbook or this is for professional purposes, this app is available to use. You can organize all of the screenshots, too. Unlike UX Recorder, there is no cost involved. Simply start taking photos of your screen immediately. You can share them, organize them, and use them as you please. They are your screenshots and images, after all. There is nothing to it.</p><p>Overall, this is a great option if you only want images. The downside is that it is not actually a screen recorder, which means no videos involved.</p><h4 id="5-Screenpresso"><a href="#5-Screenpresso" class="headerlink" title="5.

Like Ember, it focuses more on images, though you can use it for videos, too. Unlike Ember, it also focuses heavily on editing. It is for professionals. It wants to help you get all of your images and videos sorted and ready to use. This is for all professional purposes, including manuals. If there is a project that you need to do for your job, and it requires images or video, it is likely that this program can help you to manage it. It also makes it easy to import and export all images and videos.</p><p>Overall, this is a helpful tool for professionals. You can use it to start finishing up projects and adding a nice design to them.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

In fact, it has become an equally popular platform among creators and brands as YouTube. That is why creators are willing to upload creative videos and go for live streaming to engage the audiences and get brand deals. You should live stream to Instagram from OBS Studio if you want to stream from your computer.</p><p>Instagram is primarily a mobile app and Instagrammers live stream from their smartphones. However, just like YouTube, you can live stream from your computer if the popular Instagrammers are doing these days. You need OBS Studio which is available for free and it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux. In this article, we will illustrate how to use OBS to Instagram live in simple steps.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Audio-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Audio-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Audio Recorder"></a>Filmora Audio Recorder</h5><p>Record computer system audio</p><p>Capture microphone audio</p><p>Customize recording volume</p><p>Record screen and webcam as well</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137202/26400" target="_top" id="2137202">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137202" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137202/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 1\. Setup OBS Studio<p>OBS Studio is a live video stream software platform for computer users. You can live stream on almost any video streaming platform as long as you have the stream URL and stream key. On the other hand, Instagram only allows Instagram Live feature from its app. Therefore, you need a third-party app to obtain the stream URL and stream key so that you can connect OBS Studio with Instagram for live stream.</p><p>There are various third-party apps available to setup OBS Instagram live stream session.
