It can be done, we promise! We took a look to try and explain this one a little further after we found out that not everyone knows how it all works.</p><p>WhatsApp is one of our favorite communication apps, especially useful while we are all stuck at home in shelter of the virus. While <a class="link"   href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html" >social distancing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ensues, apps like this one are increasingly important.

However, you can use another third-party software to emulate the WhatsApp video call on desktop. In addition to video calls, you can use other features like on the phone.</p><p>Anyone asking, “how can I make a video call on WhatsApp Web?” is in the right place.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880976/19272" target="_top" id="1880976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880976/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Video-Call-from-WhatsApp-Web-in-Laptop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Video-Call-from-WhatsApp-Web-in-Laptop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make Video Call from WhatsApp Web in Laptop"></a>Part 2: How to Make Video Call from WhatsApp Web in Laptop</h2><p>Everyone who has done a little research will see that you can use WhatsApp Web to make calls and send messages. At first glance, it appears as though the controls are the same, but you are more limited in options because you can’t, seemingly, make video calls.</p><p>What you need is an Emulator. This clever little piece of tech was first invented to do things like playing retro video games through a modern pc. The emulator connects the missing encryptions between the two technologies. In the case of a product called <a class="link"   href="https://www.bluestacks.com/" >Bluestacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will allow you to run WhatsApp as if it were on your phone, but do it through your computer.</p><p>All you need to do is follow these instructions, and you will be making video calls in WhatsApp web in a laptop in no time!</p><p>In a few easy steps:</p><ol><li>Download an emulator – <a class="link"   href="https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html" >Bluestacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is considered an industry favorite at the moment.</li><li>Select Save, then run the application.

Skype Online"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-web/" >Skype Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Skype is one of the longest-running video calling and web calling apps. It gives you a local international ID to make long-distance calls for free, and much easier. It also has some great functions if you need to work from home or video conference. Skype has excellent customer support and some wonderful add-ons to make the experience more accessible. When it comes to a tailored, professional finish, then Skype has the most experience. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record Skype video call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype.JPG"                      alt="Skype"                ></p><h3 id="2-Google-Duo"><a href="#2-Google-Duo" class="headerlink" title="2. Google Duo"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://duo.google.com/about/" >Google Duo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you can’t figure out how to make video calls on WhatsApp Web on laptops, then Google Duo is a brilliant alternative. It allows HD video and audio chat while working with low bandwidth or bad Wi-Fi. It’s fully compatible with all things made by Google – and it works by signing into your Google account, so your friends don’t need to do very much if you invite them to a call.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-duo-app.JPG"                      alt="Google Duo"                ></p><h3 id="3-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#3-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Messenger"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.messenger.com/" >Facebook Messenger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you don’t intend to do much in the way of group chatting, then video calling in Messenger is a reliable way to see friends during the lockdown. Most people have Facebook, it will work with all their products, and it is as easy to join as clicking a link. The downside is that it only works if FB knows who you are. If you closed your account with them, then you will need to start from scratch. That being said, audio and video are both clear, you can add in file sharing, and you have the option to instant message at all times. Plus, it will sync with your contacts in much the same way as Google Duo will.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/messenger-app.JPG"                      alt="Facebook Messenger"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100527/7443" target="_top" id="2100527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Rounding-Up"><a href="#Rounding-Up" class="headerlink" title="Rounding Up"></a>Rounding Up</h2><p>So if you can’t work out how to make a WhatsApp call from a PC, try one of our other recommendations for keeping in touch.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Full-Screen-OBS-Complication-Overcome"><a href="#Full-Screen-OBS-Complication-Overcome" class="headerlink" title="Full Screen OBS Complication Overcome"></a>Full Screen OBS Complication Overcome</h2><p>OBS Studio is the most popular free video recording and streaming software. However, there are certain OBS issues that are often reported on different forums. OBS Studio not recording full screen is a common complaint. There are many who have reported that OBS is capturing Windowed screen but as soon as they are switching to Full screen recording, OBS fails miserably and captures only a black screen instead. There could be various reasons behind OBS full screen not working.</p><p>First of all, OBS Studio files could have got corrupted somehow. Sometimes, OBS Studio is heavily using CPU resources in capturing full screen, and hence, due to very fast access, CPU has limited the access of usage. There are could be a compatibility issue with OBS Studio and your Windows version. Sometimes, any third-party screen recording software could intervene in OBS operation. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to fix OBS does not recording full screen issue.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS"><a href="#Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS"></a>Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS</h2><p>By default, OBS CPU usage present is set to very fast. This means the encoder is running very fast which leads to less CPU time usage. The higher the present, the less is the CPU usage. Unless you have a high-end computer, this default setting can lead to rendering and encoding issues. OBS uses more CPU resources when you are recording full screen. CPU tends to limit its allocation for OBS when OBS starts using CPU resources at a very fast speed. This leads to OBS not full screen recording issue. You should change the setting by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and go to Controls tab.</p><p>Step 2: Click on Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-settings-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on settings button"                ></p><p>Step 3: Go to Output tab and change Output Mode from Simple to Advanced.</p><p>Step 4: Change CPU Usage Present from Veryfast to Ultrafast so that OBS uses less CPU resources for the encoding process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-cpu-usage.jpg"                      alt="obs change cpu usage"                ></p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118315/7443" target="_top" id="2118315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118315/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording"><a href="#Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording"></a>Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording</h2><p>There are certain gaming features available in Windows 10 that cause rendering issue for OBS studio. If game mode is on, all the GPU resources are used in the active game and hence, OBS suffers in performance. Similarly, if Game Bar recording is on, it interferes with OBS Studio full screen recording and leads to OBS studio not recording full screen game. You need to turn off Game Bar recording by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Settings app.</p><p>Step 2: From Setting, open Gaming option.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Xbox Game Bar tab on the left side.</p><p>4: Turn it off so that it does not record your gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-settings-xbox-game-bar.jpg"                      alt="windows settings xbox game bar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770526">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770526">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770526%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770526/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode"><a href="#Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Way 3.

Empower the Compatibility Mode</h2><p>One of the common reasons why OBS does not recording full screen is due to compatibility issue with the operating system. That is why there is an option available in Windows to run any application in compatible mode with lower Windows version. You can do the same for OBS Studio and there are many users who have reported the issue of full screen recording getting solved when they changed the compatibility mode to Windows 8. Here are the steps you have to take.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS Studio on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Start menu and open Task Manager.</p><p>Step 3: On Task manager, find OBS Studio under Apps.

Turn Your Gameplay to Windowed Mode</h2><p>When OBS Studio not recording full screen game, you have to move to Windowed Mode momentarily to ensure OBS Studio is actually capturing the gameplay or not. After capturing your gameplay in Windowed mode, you can switch to Full Screen Mode and check if the problem is solved. This helps as the default settings get reset and any issue with the settings causing the problem gets resolved. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Move your game from full screen mode to windowed mode. You need to check the Settings of your game and bring out the resolution and screen dimensions so that it moves to Windowed Mode from full screen settings.</p><p>Step 2: Open OBS Studio and from Sources, click on “+” icon and select Display Capture.</p><p>Step 3: Right-click on Display Capture and click on Windowed Projector option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-your-gameplay-to-windows-mode.jpg"                      alt="turn your gameplay to windows mode"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click on Start Recording and move to your Windowed game screen. After recording for a few seconds, click on Stop Recording. Check if the recording has been successful.</p><p>Step 5: Thereafter, you can move your game to full screen mode. On OBS, you can then select Fullscreen Projector and select your monitor. Start recording again and see if OBS can capture the full screen now.</p><h2 id="Way-5-Re-install-OBS"><a href="#Way-5-Re-install-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Re-install OBS"></a>Way 5. Re-install OBS</h2><p>Sometimes, the problem is with OBS Studio itself and not an external issue. There are times when OBS Studio may have crashed and in the process, certain important files of OBS Studio may have got corrupted. If the above solutions are not working to fix OBS not recording full screen issue, you have to uninstall and reinstall OBS Studio. In the process, you will be able to install the latest version of OBS Studio where minor glitches are fixed. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features option.</p><p>Step 2: From the list of installed applications, find OBS Studio and click on Uninstall&#x2F;Change button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/re-install-obs-uninstall.jpg"                      alt="re install obs uninstall"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once OBS Studio is successfully uninstalled, open your web browser and visit “obsproject.com”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-and-launch.jpg"                      alt="install and launch"                ></p><p>Step 4: Download and install OBS Studio as per your operating system.

Sometimes there may be distortion in the background, so individuals can mute their mic to avoid any disturbance in the meeting. It is possible for the host to mute an attendee in the meeting, or themselves as well. While the person is muted, they can still listen to what is being discussed in the meeting, but other members will not be able to listen to them until they are unmuted.</p><p>Do you want help to figure out <strong>how to mute Google Meet</strong>?

This way the participant can still hear what is going on in the session, but they are not audible to anyone else. So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.</p><p>Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Mute-Your-Microphone-in-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Mute-Your-Microphone-in-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?"></a>Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?</h2><p>While many believe using the mute feature on Google Meet is a tricky task, the question of <strong>how to mute a Google Meet</strong> is fairly simple.</p><p>All an individual has to do is click the microphone button located on the bottom of their screen and they will be muted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-microphone-on-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet Mute"                ></p><p>If they click that same button again, they will be unmuted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unmute-yourself-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet unmute"                ></p><p>However, if they do not want to make use of the screen to mute and unmute, they can use keyboard key shortcuts.

That is when muting someone can come in handy! Basically in this, a host or other participants in the meeting can mute an individual based on need. However, there is an eligibility criterion they must adhere to in order to get the muting permissions.</p><h3 id="The-Eligibility-Criteria-To-Mute-Someone-in-Google-Meet"><a href="#The-Eligibility-Criteria-To-Mute-Someone-in-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet"></a>The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet</h3><p>Before looking into <strong>how to mute someone on Google Meet</strong>, check if any of the following scenarios apply to you,</p><ul><li>During video calls that are hosted through personal Google accounts, only the moderator can mute a person.</li><li>Google Meet calls made through Google workspace accounts only permit a person, from the domain which organized the meeting, to mute a participant.</li><li>During a video call arranged by using an educational Google account, only the individual who has created the meeting &#x2F; is the owner of a calendar can mute other individuals.</li></ul><p>So, if any of these circumstances apply to you, then you can easily mute someone in a Google Meet session.

It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular.

For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat. When you get to the Ginger Island while playing the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game, you will meet Leo.

Free software often lacks the breadth of features required for flawless broadcasting, but not with OSB Studio. Even though the program is free, it features all of the crucial components that characterize online broadcasting. Many additional parts and modules will be given by the software now and then. That suggests it’s really necessary to dabble and refresh with it. Else, you can experience a few hassles in using OBS correctly.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch and Create Output Recorder Setup</strong></p><p>Add on the Plus symbol and create the project. If you want to activate audio monitoring in OBS Studio: Right-click in the Output box, Open the Output mode or you can also go for Advanced Audio Properties:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-recorder-setup.jpg"                      alt="output recorder setup"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize Record Only Feature</strong></p><p>In OBS for Mac, this setting will deliver the sound of the source to the Desktop as it were.

This takes into mind individual sound control. To do so, go to the bottom right corner of your screen and pick “settings.” Then, under “recording path,” select the “output” option to specify the spot on your computer where you desire to keep the recordings. Right after that, press the Record button to start recording your Game Audio in parallel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-mode.jpg"                      alt="output mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144298/7443" target="_top" id="2144298">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144298" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144298/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982461%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982461/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3.

How to disable crossplay? How about cross-progression? Further, which platform is the best to play on? What’s the difference between Steam and Origin?</p><p>In this article, all of the questions above will be answered. No doubt, we have seen a massive increase in the popularity of Apex Legends. Millions of players are grouping in EA’s battle royal game, and it is quite clear why they like it so much. It is a free-to-play game with some quality graphics and gameplay. This game’s core is based around looting and shooting, and it offers a few interesting twists in the battle royal format.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered"><a href="#In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered" class="headerlink" title="In this article, these questions will be answered"></a>In this article, these questions will be answered</h4><hr><p>Apex Legends Gameplay Basics:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-gameplay.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In this battle royal game, you are a part of a 3-person squad. There are 14 playable characters to choose from, and they are called legends in the game. If you compare all legends, you will find that they are equal in strength, speed, and firepower. It’s their special abilities that make them different from each other. Every character has a unique ability that can help you in-game to leverage other players. So, you can choose a legend that suits your playstyle and is a perfect fit for your squad.</p><p>Teamwork is very critical in this game. When you jump into the battleground, there are two teammates on your side. Make sure to stick with them during the match if you want to win it. By working together, you can protect each other and outmatch the enemies by combining your abilities. You can stay connected with your teammates using the in-game communication system. You can mark different locations, highlight threats, pinpoint the location of gear pieces, and tell your teammates in which direction you are going.</p><p>There is a ring around the battleground that shrinks after fixed short intervals. As the rink shrinks, it forces the players into a smaller space on the map, and as a result, we observe more fights between different teams. If you want to win the game, then you have to be the last team standing. If your teammates are knocked down, then you can revive them and pick them up. If they are completely killed, you can pick up their banner in a fixed amount of time and have them jumped back into the game once again. This feature makes this game different from other battle royal games where if your teammate dies once, then he stays dead the rest of the game.</p><p>One thing that you must keep in mind while playing this game is that killing an opponent is a bit longer than other FPS (First Person Shooting) games. To kill an opponent, you may need to rely on several headshots, your legends’ unique ability, and the support of your teammates.</p><p>Although this game is free of cost, it offers several in-game purchases. You can purchase Apex Coins, which is an in-game currency. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ingame-purchase.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You can use it to purchase loot boxes that contain skins and costumes. There are two locked characters in the game also, and you need to purchase them with Apex coins. So, you can get the maximum out of this game by spending some money and giving time to this game.</p><hr><h4 id="Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not"><a href="#Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?"></a><strong>Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?</strong></h4><p>Yes, Apex Legends is a cross-platform game. Initially, it wasn’t a cross-platform game, but Apex became a cross-platform game after an update in autumn 2020. It means that two players playing on two different devices can group in a squad and play the game. Let’s explain it with an example. Suppose you have a pc and your friend has a PS4. Both of you can play together in a squad, even if you both have two different types of devices.</p><h4 id="How-to-turn-off-crossplay"><a href="#How-to-turn-off-crossplay" class="headerlink" title="How to turn off crossplay?"></a><strong>How to turn off crossplay?</strong></h4><p>Firstly, crossplay is enabled by default. Assume now you’re playing apex on PS4&#x2F;switch&#x2F;Xbox using a controller, you might be reluctant to crossplay against a PC player using keyboard and mouse. Because you might think that isn’t fair. So why don’t we turn it off and play only with game console players?</p><p>Step1, to disable it, you need to go to the setting button at the lobby’s right bottom, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting1.png"                      alt="ape-setting1"                ></p><p>Step 2, under the gameplay tab, scroll down, and you can find cross-platform play.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting2.png"                      alt="apex-setting2"                ></p><h4 id="Does-it-have-cross-progression"><a href="#Does-it-have-cross-progression" class="headerlink" title="Does it have cross-progression?"></a><strong>Does it have cross-progression?</strong></h4><p>Unfortunately, because of technical and legal issues, no. It means that your characters&#x2F;purchased items will not be synced through platforms. Simply put, you will have to start all over again if you change your platform.</p><hr><h4 id="Which-platform-is-the-best-to-play-on"><a href="#Which-platform-is-the-best-to-play-on" class="headerlink" title="Which platform is the best to play on?"></a><strong>Which platform is the best to play on?</strong></h4><p>The best thing about Apex Legends is that it has multiplatform support. You can play it on different platforms like:</p><p><strong>Microsoft Xbox One S and X</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-one.jpg"                                     >You can play Apex Legends on Xbox One S, but you may need to compromise a little bit and play on a low resolution for better fps. Although the game will run just fine, you may need to make some adjustments to your graphics settings. You can play this game on 720p on Xbox One S, so make sure to sit a little closer to your screen to see everything.</p><p>If you want to get Apex’s best experience on Xbox consoles, you should play it on Xbox One X. If you switch from Xbox one S to Xbox one X, you will see a significant difference in the game performance. On the X version, you can run the game on 1080p. It offers overall better performance in terms of gameplay as compared to other Xbox variants.</p><p><strong>Xbox Series X and S</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                                     >Xbox series S and X are the latest generations of Xbox. They rival their competitor PS5 and offer competitive performance when you compare these consoles with a PS5. They do offer better gaming performance and better graphics. But, the question is, Can you play Apex on the latest generations of Xbox? The answer is yes. You will get better performance in terms of graphics and FPS but currently, the game isn’t fully optimized for the latest generations. In the coming days it is expected that the game will be optimized for the latest consoles and you can enjoy the game to the fullest. Currently, you can enjoy 1440p gaming on these consoles and can get up to 120fps.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 4</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ps4.png"                                     >You can also play Apex Legends on Sony PlayStation 4. Although you can play it on the standard PS4, if you want to get the best gaming experience, then you should play it on PS4 Pro. On PS4, you need to have a PlayStation Plus subscription if you want to play online multiplayer games, but in the case of Apex Legends, you do not need it.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 5</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ps5-poster.png"                      alt="ps5-poster"                ></p><p>Sony PlayStation 5 is a next-generation console, and luckily Apex Legends is already playable on it. PS5 offers improved performance and better graphics as compared to its previous versions. If you were previously playing on PS4 and just switched to PS5, you can also retain all your progress and skins on PS5 also. You can use the same EA account and start enjoying Apex Legends on 1440p screen resolution.</p><p><strong>PC</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PC-apex.png"                                     >If you want to do competitive gaming in Apex Legends, then PC is the most suitable choice for you. It is because when you play using a mouse and keyboard instead of controllers, then your aim and movement are more precise. As it is an FPS category game, you can use a monitor with a high refresh rate to have smooth gameplay and reduce the lag. You must keep in mind that you need a PC with some good specs that can provide you with at least 60fps in the game. It would be best if you aim for a PC that can provide you maximum fps. 120 is the most recommended figure here.</p><p>PC Requirements For Apex Legends:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Components</strong></th><th><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel Core i3-6100 or AMD FX-4350</td><td>Intel Core i5-3570K or AMD equivalent</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>6GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 AMD Radeon HD 7730</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 AMD Radeon R9 290</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU RAM</strong></td><td>1GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hard Drive</strong></td><td>22GB of Free Space</td><td>22GB of Free Space</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Nintendo Switch</strong></p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-switch.png"                                     ></p><p>On March 9, 2021, EA released a version of this game for Nintendo switch. Currently, it is playable on the switch, and you can only match up with switch players, but soon it will be available to play with cross-platform support.

These are basically two different platforms and have their own game launchers. As the game is free to play so you can use either one of them.</p><p>If steam is already installed on your PC then just go to the game store and add Apex Legends to your library. Otherwise, you can also go to Origin game store and get Apex Legends from there. If you compare the performance of game on both platforms then you will find that there isn’t much difference. On origin you may get slightly better performance and fps but the difference of fps is not that much. The game is free to play on both platforms so you can choose according to your comfort and preferences.</p><h4 id="How-to-Choose-Between-These-Platforms"><a href="#How-to-Choose-Between-These-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose Between These Platforms"></a><strong>How to Choose Between These Platforms</strong></h4><p>With Apex Legends available on so many platforms, sometimes it can be difficult to choose which platform is best for you. It all depends upon your preferences. If you already have a gaming console like X-box or PS4, you can play it on them. But if you want to play in a competitive environment and get the best gaming experience, then it is only possible on a PC. If you just want to chill with your friends and kill some time, then consoles can do the job for you. For maximum performance, a PC is recommended.</p><p>Bonus：Want to record and edit your wonderful Apex gameplay?

Bandicam also lets you add your webcam while recording the screen. You can schedule your recording. You can make use of the green screen technique as well. Besides, you can perform the basic editing after recording. In comparison to OBS, it is a highly user-friendly interface for easy operation.</p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements</strong> <strong>-</strong></p><ul><li>Supported OS - Windows only.</li><li>Processor - Dual-core processor or higher.</li><li>RAM - 1 GB or more.</li><li>HDD - 1 GB or more</li><li>VGA - 800x600, 16 bit color.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam"><a href="#Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam"></a>Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam</h2><p>Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong></p><p>The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Alternative Way to Record Screen Video"></a>Part 4.

You can press F9 key to stop recording.</p><p>You can then edit the recording and export in the desired file format.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To sum it up for you, OBS is completely free while Bandicam is a premium software. In terms of features, there is not much difference but Bandicam is significantly use to easy. Bandicam has more options for better screen recording but it lacks useful editing options.

Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

They can look stunning, particularly on the PS5 and Xbox Series X, and they can overwhelm with interesting new twists on the tried-and-true shooter concept. They often put us against brainy villains and those who wish to devour them. And they never fail to wow with their speed and flair.</p><p>While talking about Best Fps Games’ first-person shooters are one of the most popular game genres, picking the top 30 examples is difficult. We need a set of laws, but even then, another ten are killed by a headshot for every gunman who makes it through. On this list, we’ll look at games with first-person shooting as their main mechanic. In 2021, the game should be playable right now. Multiplayer FPS and first-person battle royales are hot, while first-person action RPGs like Fallout 4 and action-adventure games like Deathloop are out and known as best Fps games. These are the guidelines. Shooting the messenger isn’t a good idea.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the 7 best Fps games available right now.</p><h3 id="1-BLACK-MESA"><a href="#1-BLACK-MESA" class="headerlink" title="1.BLACK MESA"></a>1.BLACK MESA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/black-mesa-poster.jpg"                      alt="black-mesa-poster"                ></p><p>Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine. Black Mesa took 15 years to achieve version 1.0, but it’s well worth waiting when it was released in 2020. To offer a more condensed experience, the remake is a revised version of the classic single-player campaign, with no outdated puzzles or battle sequences. The crew also created an enhanced version of Alien planet Xen, ostensibly cut from Half-Life 1’s last chapter.</p><p>Although there’s no denying the Half-Life 1 is just a great game, particularly in light of what it achieved for PC gaming, its gameplay isn’t without flaws, which are addressed in Black Mesa. Black Mesa is the greatest way to see what you’ve been losing out on if you haven’t experienced the original Half-Life game. Black MESA is included in this list of the greatest FPS games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Recreation of Half-Life.</p><p>• More concise experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135366/19272" target="_top" id="2135366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS"><a href="#2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS" class="headerlink" title="2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS"></a>2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops.jpg"                      alt="call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops"                ></p><p>Following the success of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot and Warzone, Black Ops – Cold War needed to live up to Infinity Ward’s expectations. Fortunately, Cold War stands up to the hype, and the result is a game that is both snappy and fast-paced, two key characteristics of a successful Call of Duty game so cold war black ops make their place in the best Fps games.</p><p>Cold War embraces the absurdity of its alternative history premise, enabling the developers to include characters like John McClane and Rambo in the mix. There are various endings in the campaign, including one in which Russia wins the Cold War. The multiplayer mode, updated every two months with fresh material, has to be the game’s highlight.

Black Mesa took 15 years to achieve version 1.0, but it’s well worth waiting when it was released in 2020. To offer a more condensed experience, the remake is a revised version of the classic single-player campaign, with no outdated puzzles or battle sequences. The crew also created an enhanced version of Alien planet Xen, ostensibly cut from Half-Life 1’s last chapter.</p><p>Although there’s no denying the Half-Life 1 is just a great game, particularly in light of what it achieved for PC gaming, its gameplay isn’t without flaws, which are addressed in Black Mesa. Black Mesa is the greatest way to see what you’ve been losing out on if you haven’t experienced the original Half-Life game. Black MESA is included in this list of the greatest FPS games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Recreation of Half-Life.</p><p>• More concise experience.</p><h3 id="2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS-3"><a href="#2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS-3" class="headerlink" title="2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS"></a>2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops.jpg"                      alt="call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080333/19272" target="_top" id="2080333">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080333" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080333/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Following the success of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot and Warzone, Black Ops – Cold War needed to live up to Infinity Ward’s expectations. Fortunately, Cold War stands up to the hype, and the result is a game that is both snappy and fast-paced, two key characteristics of a successful Call of Duty game so cold war black ops make their place in the best Fps games.</p><p>Cold War embraces the absurdity of its alternative history premise, enabling the developers to include characters like John McClane and Rambo in the mix. There are various endings in the campaign, including one in which Russia wins the Cold War. The multiplayer mode, updated every two months with fresh material, has to be the game’s highlight. This isn’t limited to multiplayer maps; entirely new modes, such as the large-scale Zombies Outbreak mode, have been introduced to the game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Snappy and fast-paced.</p><p>• Multiplayer mode.</p><p>• Large-scale Zombies Outbreak mode.</p><h3 id="3-OVERWATCH-3"><a href="#3-OVERWATCH-3" class="headerlink" title="3.OVERWATCH"></a>3.OVERWATCH</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/overwatch.jpg"                      alt="overwatch"                ></p><p>If you want to compare it to Team Fortress 2 or League of Legends, go ahead. Overwatch has enough in common with both to share part of their attraction, but it’s distinct enough that figuring out the greatest character combinations will take months.</p><p>Overwatch is a cooperative game, not a game about who murdered you and how many headshots you received. More important is how you utilized your diverse combination of abilities as Mercy to rescue a vital sniper just on capture point, drive the payload forward on Reinhart’s shield, or even win around.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Eclectic mix bag of skills.</p><p>• Push the payload ahead with Reinhart’s shield.</p><h3 id="4-GLOBAL-OFFENSIVE-COUNTER-STRIKE-3"><a href="#4-GLOBAL-OFFENSIVE-COUNTER-STRIKE-3" class="headerlink" title="4.GLOBAL OFFENSIVE COUNTER-STRIKE"></a>4.GLOBAL OFFENSIVE COUNTER-STRIKE</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cs-go.png"                      alt="cs-go"                ></p><p>For the first time, stepping into the world of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is akin to plunging into a contemporary military meat grinder.

These honors are also well-deserved. Half-Life 2 is a tremendously ambitious game that benefits from being created by a much more confident valve.</p><p>Everything is larger this time around than in 1998: the settings, the adversaries, the narrative - it’s a blockbuster but a smart one.

For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds.

These days, it’s all too common for gamers to have to clear their hard drives when a new game is released.</p><p>Games like Call of Duty see the astonishing patch sizes: Warzone lately may mean you can only update a game rather than get a new one, and still, you’ll run out of space. It is possible to store hundreds of games using an external hard drive, making them available to you without downloading them again.</p><p>You will still need more storage, though an SSD is more efficient and recommended if you buy the Xbox Series S or Series X.</p><p>If you’re looking for a bit more space, we’ve created a list of the best Xbox external hard drives.</p><h2 id="Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024"><a href="#Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024"></a><strong>Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive"><a href="#1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="1.

With this drive, you get a standard Seagate drive in a flashier case. The (admittedly quite nice) embossed Xbox logo and official green case are an additional $15-20. It’s a great choice if the price is right for you, and aesthetics are a concern. Esthetics are important to me, so I think this is the best choice. As often happens around big retail events, Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive in official Xbox green often drops in price, so though this is a great time to buy, we can expect further savings in the coming months.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01065S79E/" >Check on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Fast and Reliable</li><li>Vast Storage of 2TB</li><li>Compatible with different versions of Xbox.</li><li>It is a value for money hard drive.</li></ul><h4 id="2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive"><a href="#2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="2.

The metal topside gives it a bit of a shipping container aesthetic even though it’s not listed as an armored or “rugged” hard drive. The hard drive remains cool even after extensive usage and runs quietly without making any noise.</p><p>Although the drive’s write speed is not special at 130 megabytes per second, we found that it matched the console’s internal hard drive, So you can run the games directly from the hard drive without worrying about any lags or delays.</p><p>The best thing about this hard drive is that you can find it with different storage capacities ranging from 1Tb to 5Tb. So, the users have the option to choose suitable storage options according to their needs.</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VNTFHD5" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features</strong>:</p><ul><li>It is extremely portable</li><li>Always runs quietly and cool</li><li>The 3-year warranty is quite reasonable.</li><li>Price is high but is value for money.</li></ul><h4 id="3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance"><a href="#3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance" class="headerlink" title="3.

With a sleek, glossy design, a simple, elegant design, and a nice blue power-light on top, the Toshiba Canvio Advance is an attractive piece of kit. Works just fine. All the drives on this list match its read and write speeds, and it comes with a two-year warranty. Your Xbox console has a USB port that you can connect to, and proceed as usual…</p><p>Additionally, suppose you want to use it for PCs as well. In that case, it includes password protection and automatic backup of files, both of which make it a better budget pick than our previous budget pick, the Canvio Basics. There is only one real disadvantage to the Advance: it does not come in green, so you cannot match it with your console. Nonetheless, white looks slick next to many Xbox consoles. You cannot beat the price of the 1TB version, which is around $50 &#x2F; £50.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Canvio-Advance-Portable-External/dp/B08JKFY8FH/" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Small and Compact In Size</li><li>Available in multiple colors.</li><li>Extremely affordable.</li><li>Standard speed but matches to that of your console.</li></ul><h4 id="4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB"><a href="#4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB" class="headerlink" title="4.

Key Features of Ezvid"></a>1. Key Features of Ezvid</h2><p>Ezvid video maker is a great screen recording software and here are the features that the software has to offer to satisfy all the requirements of the video creators.</p><p><strong>Record Screen and Facecam</strong></p><p>Ezvid is an incredible screen recorder to capture your desktop screen as well as browser screen. The user interface is clean and there is a direct option available to start recording the entire screen. Moreover, there are advanced options available such as capturing a region of the screen instead of the entire screen.</p><p>Besides, you can record Facecam which is extremely important for video creators who show the screen as well as their face on the same video simultaneously. This makes the video more relatable and professional. Therefore, apart from recording the entire or part of the screen, you can record from the webcam and both the capturing is put together in the same video.</p><p><strong>Instant Screen Drawing</strong></p><p>Instead of waiting for the screen recording to get over and editing the recorded video to add drawings, you can add the required drawings live while recording the screen with Ezvid screen recorder. This simple feature is going to save you a lot of time as there is no further editing required. There are ample drawings available to illustrate on the screen and draw the attention of the viewers in the highlighted areas.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Recording</strong></p><p>Apart from recording desktop screen as well as browser screen, there is a special and dedicated feature to capture the screen while playing games.

After recording the game screen, you can edit the video and upload it on social media and video streaming platforms.</p><p><strong>Free Music Addition</strong></p><p>One of the main reasons why a good-quality video stands out from a basic video is the background music. You will find only a few screen recorders and video editors to add free music in the background of the video as per your preference and requirements. This makes the video soothing and pleasant to the ears rather than just being pleasant to the eyes. There is no need to search online for free music to add to your screen recordings as you can find suitable music for your video from Ezvid library.</p><p><strong>Control Video Speed</strong></p><p>You know how important it is to regulate video speed so that the crucial moments are recorded at a slow speed while not so important parts can be at a high speed. There are only a few screen recorders available that allow users to control video speed. This is a necessary feature professional video creators always look for in a screen recording and video editing software.</p><p><strong>Instant Slideshow Maker -</strong></p><p>Instead of making and editing videos all the time, you can also use Ezvid to make slideshows using screenshots and photos. There are beautiful transitions and effects available and you can add texts and drawings. You can make the slideshows instantly and share them with anyone on any platform. Therefore, Ezvid video maker can be used as a screen recorder as well as slideshow maker.</p><p>Besides, you can add voice over to the recorded video to make it more professional and interesting.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2.
