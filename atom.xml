    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Comprehensive-Tutorial-Adding-Timer-Functionality-to-OBS"><a href="#Comprehensive-Tutorial-Adding-Timer-Functionality-to-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Comprehensive Tutorial: Adding Timer Functionality to OBS"></a>Comprehensive Tutorial: Adding Timer Functionality to OBS</h2><p>OBS Studio is arguably the best free, open-source screen recorder for Mac, Windows, and Linux computers. It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known <strong>OBS countdown timer</strong>.</p><p>So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?"></a>Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?</h2><p>You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.</p><p>With that said, you can use the <strong>OBS timer countdown</strong> in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer"                ></p><p>So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.</p><p>Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.</p><p>So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an <strong>OBS count down timer</strong>, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!</p><p>Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name. For instance, you can name it Timer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-2.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add a text source"                ></p><p>Step2 Now you’ll see a pop-up window to customize how the timer will look. For example, click the Select font button to customize the font settings for the countdown timer. You can also customize things like opacity, gradient, background color, alignment, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-3.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer customize timer details"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, click the Tools tab and then tap Scripts. Then, select the countdown.lua file and customize the countdown descriptions on the pop-up window. You can change the countdown duration and the final text after the countdown. Don’t also forget to select Timer as the Text Source. The OBS countdown timer will immediately start counting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-4.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add the timer file"                ></p><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer"></a>Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer</h2><p>You’ll definitely need precise timing to get the most out of the <strong>timer countdown on OBS</strong>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Commanders’-Crown-The-Ultimate-Ranking-of-7-Total-War-Classics"><a href="#Commanders’-Crown-The-Ultimate-Ranking-of-7-Total-War-Classics" class="headerlink" title="Commanders’ Crown: The Ultimate Ranking of 7 Total War Classics"></a>Commanders’ Crown: The Ultimate Ranking of 7 Total War Classics</h2><p>It’s a tough task to choose the best total war games. Everyone has a favorite—the game that first introduced them to the series or allowed them to immerse themselves in a historical era they’d always been fascinated with. When you find a historical era you didn’t even know much about, as I did through Shogun 2 &amp; Three Kingdoms, it sparks your interest.</p><p>Warhammer 3 introduces survival combat, a fresh Three Kingdoms game is announced, Saga: Troy tries mythology on it for size, the franchise is expanding in more ways than ever before. Classics, though, are still available. One of the most compelling aspects is that, despite their differences, they all have a sense of cohesiveness. You can dive into anything and always find something in common.</p><p>For many individuals, Total War has a special place in their hearts, and it’s always enjoyable to go back and play games from the series whenever the mood strikes. I’m constantly attracted back to films like Attila, Fall of the Samurai, and Rome 2, to name a few. Regardless of whatever one you favor, they all provide a similar combination of struggle and failure, conquest, and dominance.</p><p>The Best Total War games on their own are listed here.</p><h3 id="1-Attila-the-Hun"><a href="#1-Attila-the-Hun" class="headerlink" title="1.Attila the Hun"></a>1.Attila the Hun</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/attila-the-hun-poster.png"                      alt="attila-the-hun-poster"                ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun. At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War"></a>2.Rome 2 Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War"></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall"></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan’s destiny.</p><p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><h3 id="5-Warhammer-2"><a href="#5-Warhammer-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Warhammer 2"></a>5.Warhammer 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></p><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development. The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><h3 id="6-Total-War-Medieval-2"><a href="#6-Total-War-Medieval-2" class="headerlink" title="6.Total War Medieval 2"></a>6.Total War Medieval 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></p><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response. Medieval 2 is essentially the same game as Medieval 1, but with improved visuals, updated gameplay, and additional features. Who’d have guessed that would suffice?</p><p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><h3 id="7-Shogun-2-Total-War"><a href="#7-Shogun-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="7.Shogun 2: Total War"></a>7.Shogun 2: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun.

Whether it is a meeting, online class, or brainstorming session, it becomes a whole lot easier with a PowerPoint slideshow - bringing everyone on the same page!</p><p>You must be wondering <strong>how to share ppt in Google Meet</strong>, well the process is fairly simple and extremely functional. You will only need two tools to execute this screen-sharing process, a web browser, and Microsoft PowerPoint. We would advise that you use Google Chrome as your web browser as it works best with Google Meet.</p><p>Just a heads up, when you are presenting your screen on Google Meet, everyone can see what you display, so it’s best to open up your PowerPoint slides before joining the meeting so there are no surprises!</p><ol><li>Open the Microsoft PowerPoint Slides on your laptop, the model or brand of the laptop does not matter, as long as you have Microsoft PowerPoint on it</li><li>Convert your slides from the default mode to browsed by an individual mode. If you have used Microsoft PowerPoint before, then you must know that in slideshow mode the slides appear in fullscreen making it difficult to switch between applications, therefore by converting the PowerPoint it will be windowed fullscreen, allowing the presenter to switch between applications. The process is simple, just click the “Slide Show” tab, then “Set Up Slide Show”, and from the drop-down menu press “Browsed by an Individual”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerpoint-browsed-by-individual.jpg"                      alt="set PowerPoint to individual browse"                ></p><ol><li>After setting up the PowerPoint slides, move over to Google Meet and join the meeting through the meeting link provided or schedule in a new meeting.

However, before you embark on this adventure, there are a few things you should know about screencasting software, which is why we are going to provide you with all the information you’ll need to choose the right screencasting software.</p><ul><li><a href="#advantage">Part 1: Why Using Screencasting?</a></li><li><a href="#pick">Part 2: How to Pick Screencasting software?</a></li><li><a href="#choose">Part 3: Which screencasting software should I choose?</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Advantages-of-Using-Screencasting-Software"><a href="#Part-1-The-Advantages-of-Using-Screencasting-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Advantages of Using Screencasting Software"></a>Part 1: The Advantages of Using Screencasting Software</h2><p>What type of screencast videos you are going to make depends on what you want to communicate. For example, large companies can easily make screencasts to welcome their new team members and walk them through their new duties. In this manner, producing a screencast can save time that can be invested in more pressing issues than the guiding of the newcomers through each step of their new job.</p><p>Furthermore, a screencast can serve as a guide that answers all sorts of frequently asked questions. Instead of writing detailed explanations that take a lot of time to read, you can create a screencast that can be shared as many times you want or posted on your website to help users of your products get all the answers they need.</p><p>Screencasts can be utilized as an effective way to make attractive sales pitches, product demos, software walk-throughs and even for giving the feedback to your clients or customers. In addition, screencast videos can be used for educational purposes, since a screencast is a perfect tool for the production of a tutorial on literally any subject you can think of.</p><p>To make things even better, screencasts can be used for fun, because capturing the gameplay of your favorite video game and sharing it online is easy, all you need is a great screencasting software and you can share your gaming skills with the rest of the world.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Key-Features-You-Should-Look-For-When-Picking-the-Screencasting-Software"><a href="#Part-2-Key-Features-You-Should-Look-For-When-Picking-the-Screencasting-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Key Features You Should Look For When Picking the Screencasting Software?"></a>Part 2: Key Features You Should Look For When Picking the Screencasting Software?</h2><p>Your ideas will not look as good in the real world as they did when you imagined them if you don’t have the right tools to produce them. That is why picking the right screencasting software capable of high-end performances is so important. You can find a lot of material on the Internet about the best screencasting options currently available on the market, but the information about the features you have to consider before you purchase a software that enables you to produce screencasts is often scarce.</p><p>Testing each software you find in the top ten articles will take too much of your time, so instead, you should take a close look at the list of the software’s features and make sure that its video recording and video editing options are powerful enough to create visually impressive videos. Here are the key features you should pay close attention to when choosing your new screencasting software.</p><h4 id="1-Capture-options"><a href="#1-Capture-options" class="headerlink" title="1. Capture options"></a>1. Capture options</h4><p>The amount of creative freedom provided by the software’s capture options is directly related to the quality of screencasts you’ll be able to make. If the software you are using doesn’t allow you to specify the area of the screen you want to capture or if it can only produce low-quality videos, then the screen recorder you are thinking of buying is not your best option. A good screencasting software should offer plenty of different video file sizes, audio recording options as well as the option to record footage with your webcam while simultaneously capturing the screen of your computer.</p><h4 id="2-Video-and-audio-editing-tools"><a href="#2-Video-and-audio-editing-tools" class="headerlink" title="2. Video and audio editing tools"></a>2. Video and audio editing tools</h4><p>We all make mistakes, the important thing is to know how to correct them. Almost all screen recordings need to go through the video editing process, simply because they often contain mistakes that shouldn’t be included in the final cut of the video. Audio editing options are equally important, since you can accidentally record background noises during a screen capturing session, and being able to remove them right away without using pricy audio editing software can save you a lot of money.</p><h4 id="3-How-easy-is-it-to-use"><a href="#3-How-easy-is-it-to-use" class="headerlink" title="3. How easy is it to use?"></a>3. How easy is it to use?</h4><p>You don’t have to be a film industry professional in order to be able to use a screen recording software, although some of these computer programs are needlessly complicated and require a professional level of video making skills. The screen capturing process should be simple and fun, which is why it is better to choose the screencasting software that enables you to set up the screen recording sessions quickly.</p><h4 id="4-Saving-capacity"><a href="#4-Saving-capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. Saving capacity"></a>4. Saving capacity</h4><p>How good a screen recording software really is, depends on its video output options. The size options for the video files you are making when capturing a screen, the number of different video file formats in which that file can be saved or the software’s export options should all play a role in the process of making a decision which screencasting software you should buy. Look for screencasting software products that allow you to save your videos in commonly used file formats like MP.4 or that use  encoder, because you may experience problems if you try to upload AVI or WMW video files to an online video sharing platform.</p><p>Exporting video files directly from the software to YouTube of Twitch is a huge advantage since it allows to save an enormous amount of time on waiting for the files to be exported from the software and then upload them to the Internet.</p><h2 id="Part-3-So-Which-Screencasting-Software-Should-You-Choose"><a href="#Part-3-So-Which-Screencasting-Software-Should-You-Choose" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: So, Which Screencasting Software Should You Choose?"></a>Part 3: So, Which Screencasting Software Should You Choose?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>We’ve covered just a fraction of the factors that must be taken into account before deciding to purchase a certain screencasting software product. Paying attention to frame rates as well as live broadcast features can help you narrow down the list of screen recorders worth considering. The type of screencast you want to make should also help you decide which software to buy because if you just want to make a short screen recording you don’t really need the<strong>HD</strong> option, so buying a software that lets you create <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>4K</strong></a> videos isn’t the right choice for you. On the other hand, if the video quality is your priority, then a 4K video option is a must, but the number of Annotations the software product offers may not be so important.</p><p>A good Screencasting software should be well-equipped, user-friendly and easy to use, since its main purpose is to make the screen recording process effortless, so you can focus on the quality of the content you are producing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-all-encompassing-az-screenshot-tool-app-evaluations/"><u>[New] In 2024, All-Encompassing AZ Screenshot Tool  App Evaluations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-leading-video-chatting-software-for-teams/"><u>In 2024, Leading Video Chatting Software for Teams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-innovative-strategies-for-effective-macscreencasting/"><u>[New] Innovative Strategies for Effective MacScreencasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-behind-the-scenes-mastering-4-techniques-of-xbox-capture-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Behind the Scenes  Mastering 4 Techniques of Xbox Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-new-chapter-for-recording-tech-dive-into-the-2023-apeaksoft-update/"><u>2024 Approved  A New Chapter for Recording Tech?

It is open-source software, and all the features are completely free to use. It is also a cross-platform software that you can use across all desktop operating systems. Apart from capturing screen, you can record video from webcam as well. In fact, it supports different external devices for capturing video including capture card for gaming consoles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>Besides, you can record video with audio from system as well as external sources. You can live stream on almost every platform using OBS which is why it is so popular among video creators.

The only issue with OBS Studio is that its user interface is slightly complicated.</p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements -</strong></p><ul><li>Supported OS - Windows, Mac, Linux.</li><li>Processor - Dual-core processor or higher.</li><li>RAM - 2 GB or more.</li><li>HDD - 1 GB or more.</li><li>VGA - 800x600, 16 bit color.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-About-Bandicam"><a href="#Part-2-About-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. About Bandicam"></a>Part 2. About Bandicam</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is specially designed for Windows PC users. You can capture high-quality videos as well as retain the quality of the recordings. The advantage of using Bandicam is that it lets you capture video with more compression rate. It lets you record from external sources like PlayStation, webcam, and smartphones. You can even add voice along with the system sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bandicam-screen-recorder-for-pc.jpg"                      alt="bandicam screen recorder"                ></p><p>It allows real-time drawing while recording. Bandicam also lets you add your webcam while recording the screen. You can schedule your recording. You can make use of the green screen technique as well. Besides, you can perform the basic editing after recording. In comparison to OBS, it is a highly user-friendly interface for easy operation.</p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements</strong> <strong>-</strong></p><ul><li>Supported OS - Windows only.</li><li>Processor - Dual-core processor or higher.</li><li>RAM - 1 GB or more.</li><li>HDD - 1 GB or more</li><li>VGA - 800x600, 16 bit color.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam"><a href="#Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam"></a>Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam</h2><p>Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong></p><p>The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Alternative Way to Record Screen Video"></a>Part 4.

In terms of features, there is not much difference but Bandicam is significantly use to easy. Bandicam has more options for better screen recording but it lacks useful editing options. If you are looking for a better alternative Bandicam, we recommend Wondershare Filmora and you can record and edit video like a professional.</p><p>Part 1.

Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:</p><ul><li>Xbox one</li><li>PlayStation Vita</li><li>iOS</li><li>Android</li><li>MacOS</li><li>Linux, and even;</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul><p>Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit. If you never knew, Stardew Valley Ginger Island is filled with fun activities as well as puzzles.</p><h2 id="Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>It must be clearly stated that Stardew Valley Ginger Island is where the majority of the new content of Stardew Valley takes place. If you never knew, the 1.5 update of Stardew Valley has a whole lot to offer, ranging from new items, areas, places to build your farm, and even some new characters.</p><p>Above all, Ginger Island is most likely the most significant part of the Stardew Valley 1.5 update. For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat. When you get to the Ginger Island while playing the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game, you will meet Leo. The first thing to know about Leo is that he is a shy person though he is not interested in the player. As a shy person, he befriends both animals and players subtly. When he befriends you, he can begin considering making a move into town. The move to town will make Leo more accessible. In all, Leo is simply a child that will manage to successfully befriend Jas and Vincent whenever he is fully settled in the new home in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.</p><h2 id="Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>Some of the intriguing addition players will love in Stardew Valley Ginger Island include:</p><h3 id="1-Volcano-dungeon"><a href="#1-Volcano-dungeon" class="headerlink" title="1.Volcano dungeon"></a>1.Volcano dungeon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon"                ></p><p>This is regarded as an enormous draw for adventurous players.

Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit.

For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat.
