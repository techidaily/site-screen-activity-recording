Frame drop is a common issue if you are using OBS Studio for recording high-end games or live streaming with high output resolution. You can easily understand about OBS drop frames while streaming when your viewers complain about lagging and stuttering.</p><p>In fact, you can even check OBS stream status to find out about OBS Studio drop frames.

It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.</p><p>Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-video-birate.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the video birate"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority"><a href="#Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority" class="headerlink" title="Way 4.

The quickest and easiest way to accomplish this is to use the hardware keys on your tablet, since other methods of taking screenshots on tablets may require you to invest more time and effort. Simply hold the Windows and Volume Down buttons and the device will take a screenshot that will be saved in the Screenshots folder, located in Pictures library. If you want to edit the screenshot you created on your tablet, you can use a photo editing app that enables you to crop the image or annotate the screenshot.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Taking screenshots on Windows 7,8 or 10 is a fun process that doesn’t require you to be a tech geek. Each method of creating screenshots we described in this article is equally effective, so anyone can choose the one they find the most convenient. Using Screen Sketch or Snipping Tool is the best option for PC owners who want to add annotations to their screenshots, while the PrtScrn button method is by far the quickest way to create a still image of a computer screen.</p><p>Leave a comment and let us know what is your favorite method of taking screenshots on PCs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mellow-playtime-10-top-rated-stress-erasers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mellow Playtime  10 Top-Rated Stress Erasers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-video-capture-a-deep-dive-into-tunefab-products/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Video Capture  A Deep Dive Into Tunefab Products</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ultimate-guide-to-filming-live-scenes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Ultimate Guide to Filming Live Scenes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ultimate-screenshot-and-recorder-windows-10/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Ultimate Screenshot & Recorder, Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-3-affordable-switch-game-duplicates/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 3 Affordable Switch Game Duplicates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-pioneering-screen-capture-methods-with-adobe-captivity-unveiled/"><u>[New] Pioneering Screen Capture Methods with Adobe Captivity Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-automating-meeting-times-a-google-meet-essential/"><u>2024 Approved  Automating Meeting Times  A Google Meet Essential</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-dreamlands-choice-ultimate-10-affordable-rpg-games-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Dreamland's Choice  Ultimate 10 Affordable RPG Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-universal-method-for-recording-your-preferred-youtube-stream-no-matter-the-device/"><u>In 2024, Universal Method for Recording Your Preferred YouTube Stream, No Matter the Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-depth-review-the-complete-guide-to-streamlabs-obs-for-2024/"><u>[New] In-Depth Review  The Complete Guide to Streamlabs OBS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-artistry-your-ultimate-companion-for-boomerangs-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Artistry  Your Ultimate Companion for Boomerangs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-metaverse-makeover-easy-avatar-construction/"><u>In 2024, The Metaverse Makeover  Easy Avatar Construction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-8-memoji-makers-to-make-a-memoji-on-pc-android-and-iphone/"><u>Updated In 2024, Top 8 Memoji Makers to Make a Memoji on PC, Android & iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-mirror-apple-iphone-13-to-roku-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Mirror Apple iPhone 13 to Roku?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Screen-Recording-Simplified-Review-Insights"><a href="#Screen-Recording-Simplified-Review-Insights" class="headerlink" title="Screen Recording Simplified: Review Insights"></a>Screen Recording Simplified: Review Insights</h2><p>If you like to record video games, Fraps can help you take your YouTube channel to new heights. Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install"></a>1. Download and Install</h2><p>Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program’s full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings. Games that utilize OpenGL and DirectX technologies are compatible with the system.</p><p>DOWNLOAD LINK: <a class="link"   href="https://fraps.com/" >FRAPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps"><a href="#2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Record Screen with Fraps"></a>2. How to Record Screen with Fraps</h2><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> When you first launch Fraps, you’ll see that there isn’t much to it. There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS &gt; Benchmark Settings to your desire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg"                      alt="fps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest “X” seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movies.jpg"                      alt="movies"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3. Pros and Cons"></a>3. Pros and Cons</h2><p>The number of frames per second (FPS) may be seen in the corner of the screen by users. After a picture is acquired, the platform automatically names and timestamps it. It also includes features for video files such as movie cursor hiding, stereoscopic 3D, and RGB capturing.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Fraps enable you to record high-quality DirectX or OpenGL games.</li><li>It enables you to see the number of frames per second (FPS) that you are receiving.</li><li>You may also snap a screenshot at any time interval using Fraps.</li><li>It enables you to record high-quality DirectX and OpenGL games.</li><li>It’s free to use for frame rate display and benchmarking, and it’s free to use for video capture with certain restrictions (30-second time limit).</li><li>It enables you to simultaneously record your games with computer sound and your voice.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Your computer screen, webcam, or face cam cannot be recorded.</li><li>The Microsoft Store does not enable you to record DirectX 12 or Windows games.</li><li>It is not possible to record the computer screen or webcam.</li><li>You can’t post a captured video to YouTube or Vimeo using it.</li><li>The Mac version of Fraps Screen Recorder is currently unavailable.</li></ul><h2 id="4-Best-Fraps-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Fraps-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4. Best Fraps Alternative"></a>4. Best Fraps Alternative</h2><p>One of its primary issues may have an impact on the game’s internal performance. When using Frap Screen Recorder to record, the quality of the recording degrades by roughly 13%. It may create lag and sluggish progress on their computer, and the reason for this may be due to the game’s high settings; thus, the game should be adjusted to the lowest level and played at a lower resolution.

Filmora Screen Recorder is another choice for Fraps Screen Recorder.

How to Record Video with Streamlabs"></a>2. How to Record Video with Streamlabs</h2><p>It’s good to know that Streamlabs has a few choices to play with if you’re using a graphics card encoder. Try Recording if you don’t require a lot of quality, and if it doesn’t enough, you can always move up to High-Quality Recording. Consider the size of the files before using Indistinguishable or Near-Lossless Recording if you require high-quality recordings. Many of the other settings on the Recording panel have to do with bitrate when you go to Advanced. As part of your recording setup, this is essentially the greater the bitrate, the bigger the file size of the video. To avoid pixelated video, it is best to keep the bitrate at a reasonable level. So beginning with the Streamlabs OBS download for pc, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide for you.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Install-and-Launch-Streamlabs-OBS"><a href="#Step-1-Install-and-Launch-Streamlabs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install and Launch Streamlabs OBS"></a>Step 1: Install and Launch Streamlabs OBS</h2><p>The method of installation is really simple. It’s a one-of-a-kind experience. Streamlabs OBS has to be installed first. Streamlabs OBS pre-configures everything for you and takes you right to your dashboard after you’ve finished the Windows installation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Setup-the-Recording-and-Streaming-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Setup-the-Recording-and-Streaming-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Setup the Recording and Streaming Settings"></a>Step 2: Setup the Recording and Streaming Settings</h2><p>The next step is to personalize the settings and link your Twitch or YouTube account to the device. By selecting ‘Login’ in the upper right-hand corner of Streamlabs OBS, you may sign in to your Twitch or YouTube account. Run the Auto Optimizer by going to Settings &gt; General.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamingsettings.jpg"                      alt="streamsettings"                ></p><h2 id="Step-3-Save-or-Share-Directly"><a href="#Step-3-Save-or-Share-Directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Save or Share Directly"></a>Step 3: Save or Share Directly</h2><p>A few clicks and the ‘starting soon’ or ‘facial cam and video game’ scenes are already in place. The next step is to enter your stream key so that Streamlabs OBS may upload your material to the platform for viewing by other subscribers. Click Settings &gt; Stream &gt; and then input your stream key to do this. In the lower right-hand corner, click “Go Live” to begin streaming. If you’re encoding with x264, you’ll have to enter these values by hand. The best bitrate depends on your screen size and set-up, so there isn’t a universal setting that works for everyone. When recording at 60 frames per second in 1080p, you can start with 40,000kbps and adjust as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-or-share.jpg"                      alt="save or share"                ></p><h2 id="3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Computer-Screen"><a href="#3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Computer-Screen" class="headerlink" title="3. Alternative Way to Record Computer Screen"></a>3. Alternative Way to Record Computer Screen</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, there’s a difference between OBS and Streamlabs OBS – Streamlabs, such as chat windows and a dashboard, are included. The Streamlabs OBS helps you keep track of your donations and fans. With pre-made themes and templates, it is also easier to incorporate them in a live stream. Non-Streamlabs versions of OBS still support OBS templates, themes, and overlays. But due to its lacking of various features, there’s an alternative to it namely Wondershare Filmora. Both streaming and real-time recording are possible with Filmora screen recorder, which produces HD video quality and is easy to use. Thus, the study explains how to record YouTube videos and how to view them online.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Step-1-Get-the-Software"><a href="#Step-1-Get-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Get the Software"></a>Step 1: Get the Software</h2><p>As an option, you can record the screen in high-definition (HD). The first step in setting up Wondershare Filmora is to download it from the company’s website and then run the setup file that is downloaded. Once it has been installed, you can run it from your computer. To begin recording, you must click the “Record Mode” menu after the software has been launched. As a result, a new screen will be displayed. In this section, you’ll need to select the area of your computer that you want to record. You can change the recording area’s size by dragging the dotted red color bar, or you can manually enter the screen’s dimensions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-mode.jpg"                      alt="record mode"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode"><a href="#Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode"></a>Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode</h2><p>A camera attached to your computer will automatically be detected and begin recording your activities as soon as you finish the installation. If you want to record part of the screen to use in your tutorial, you can do so in a variety of ways, including by selecting a specific area of the screen to record. Both webcam and screen captures are supported by Filmora. If you prefer, you can take advantage of an external camera.

How to Record Video with Streamlabs"></a>2. How to Record Video with Streamlabs</h2><p>It’s good to know that Streamlabs has a few choices to play with if you’re using a graphics card encoder. Try Recording if you don’t require a lot of quality, and if it doesn’t enough, you can always move up to High-Quality Recording. Consider the size of the files before using Indistinguishable or Near-Lossless Recording if you require high-quality recordings. Many of the other settings on the Recording panel have to do with bitrate when you go to Advanced. As part of your recording setup, this is essentially the greater the bitrate, the bigger the file size of the video. To avoid pixelated video, it is best to keep the bitrate at a reasonable level. So beginning with the Streamlabs OBS download for pc, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide for you.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Install-and-Launch-Streamlabs-OBS"><a href="#Step-1-Install-and-Launch-Streamlabs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install and Launch Streamlabs OBS"></a>Step 1: Install and Launch Streamlabs OBS</h2><p>The method of installation is really simple. It’s a one-of-a-kind experience. Streamlabs OBS has to be installed first. Streamlabs OBS pre-configures everything for you and takes you right to your dashboard after you’ve finished the Windows installation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Setup-the-Recording-and-Streaming-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Setup-the-Recording-and-Streaming-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Setup the Recording and Streaming Settings"></a>Step 2: Setup the Recording and Streaming Settings</h2><p>The next step is to personalize the settings and link your Twitch or YouTube account to the device. By selecting ‘Login’ in the upper right-hand corner of Streamlabs OBS, you may sign in to your Twitch or YouTube account. Run the Auto Optimizer by going to Settings &gt; General.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamingsettings.jpg"                      alt="streamsettings"                ></p><h2 id="Step-3-Save-or-Share-Directly"><a href="#Step-3-Save-or-Share-Directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Save or Share Directly"></a>Step 3: Save or Share Directly</h2><p>A few clicks and the ‘starting soon’ or ‘facial cam and video game’ scenes are already in place. The next step is to enter your stream key so that Streamlabs OBS may upload your material to the platform for viewing by other subscribers. Click Settings &gt; Stream &gt; and then input your stream key to do this. In the lower right-hand corner, click “Go Live” to begin streaming. If you’re encoding with x264, you’ll have to enter these values by hand. The best bitrate depends on your screen size and set-up, so there isn’t a universal setting that works for everyone. When recording at 60 frames per second in 1080p, you can start with 40,000kbps and adjust as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-or-share.jpg"                      alt="save or share"                ></p><h2 id="3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Computer-Screen"><a href="#3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Computer-Screen" class="headerlink" title="3. Alternative Way to Record Computer Screen"></a>3. Alternative Way to Record Computer Screen</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, there’s a difference between OBS and Streamlabs OBS – Streamlabs, such as chat windows and a dashboard, are included. The Streamlabs OBS helps you keep track of your donations and fans. With pre-made themes and templates, it is also easier to incorporate them in a live stream. Non-Streamlabs versions of OBS still support OBS templates, themes, and overlays. But due to its lacking of various features, there’s an alternative to it namely Wondershare Filmora. Both streaming and real-time recording are possible with Filmora screen recorder, which produces HD video quality and is easy to use. Thus, the study explains how to record YouTube videos and how to view them online.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Step-1-Get-the-Software"><a href="#Step-1-Get-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Get the Software"></a>Step 1: Get the Software</h2><p>As an option, you can record the screen in high-definition (HD). The first step in setting up Wondershare Filmora is to download it from the company’s website and then run the setup file that is downloaded. Once it has been installed, you can run it from your computer. To begin recording, you must click the “Record Mode” menu after the software has been launched. As a result, a new screen will be displayed. In this section, you’ll need to select the area of your computer that you want to record. You can change the recording area’s size by dragging the dotted red color bar, or you can manually enter the screen’s dimensions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-mode.jpg"                      alt="record mode"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode"><a href="#Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode"></a>Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode</h2><p>A camera attached to your computer will automatically be detected and begin recording your activities as soon as you finish the installation. If you want to record part of the screen to use in your tutorial, you can do so in a variety of ways, including by selecting a specific area of the screen to record. Both webcam and screen captures are supported by Filmora. If you prefer, you can take advantage of an external camera. This feature is bolstered by the ability to select your preferred video recording resolution while you are filming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enter-the-recording-mode.jpg"                      alt="enter the recording mode"                ></p><p>It’s like when recording video, by default, the system’s audio is recorded, but this can be disabled. The built-in microphone can also be used, as well as an external microphone. For example, in gameplay videos, the audio-visuals of the game are just as important as the player’s reaction to the game. In addition, live streaming and online tutorials have become increasingly popular.</p><h2 id="Steps3-Set-Audio-Screen-Recording-Region"><a href="#Steps3-Set-Audio-Screen-Recording-Region" class="headerlink" title="Steps3: Set Audio&#x2F;Screen Recording Region"></a>Steps3: Set Audio&#x2F;Screen Recording Region</h2><p>You can now quickly and easily record audio for the video that was created with the screenshot using Wondershare Filmora (or the camera recording). An external microphone or the computer’s built-in recording system can be used for this. You can learn how to quickly and easily add your comments to the top of the page by watching the video below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-audio.jpg"                      alt="set audio"                ></p><p>All of this has to do with video in some way. It is possible to edit, mute, and add music and voiceovers to the soundtrack that contains your recordings at the bottom of the screen.</p><h2 id="Step-4-Editing-Your-Recorded-Video"><a href="#Step-4-Editing-Your-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Editing Your Recorded Video"></a>Step 4: Editing Your Recorded Video</h2><p>The idea of putting a small screen above an instructional or video recording and allowing viewers to leave comments is another intriguing one. This is a simple way to record your thoughts about the game or the subject matter you’re currently studying, and it doesn’t require much effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/editing.jpg"                      alt="editing"                ></p><p>Pushing the button starts the recording process. For your convenience, the video editing menu will be displayed directly on the screen once the recording is complete. It’s easy to use, but it has a lot of potentials. There is a library of available media to choose from while setting up a project on the left (movies, records, music) (for example, audio files). From that screen, you can import any files you need from your computer, cell phone, or any other source.</p><h2 id="Step-5-Export-Your-Masterpiece"><a href="#Step-5-Export-Your-Masterpiece" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Export Your Masterpiece"></a>Step 5: Export Your Masterpiece</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-your-masterpiece.jpg"                      alt="export your masterpiece"                ></p><p>Your screen recordings can now be saved directly to your computer’s hard drive, in whatever format you prefer. Alternatively, you can upload them to YouTube and share them directly with your audience. You must first click on the Export button in the upper right corner of the screen to begin the export process. Simply export the file in the format of your choice (MP4, MOV, AVI, MP3, or GIF), adjust the encoding quality and resolution to your liking, and then distribute it on social media platforms, websites, and other online platforms - Media.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>While using Streamlabs, most of the templates available are nothing more than standard graphics files. You can use them on virtually every major streaming platform, from Twitch to YouTube to Facebook Gaming and everywhere else. You can create your streaming templates if you are a skilled designer and have access to appropriate graphics software, such as Adobe Photoshop or Fireworks. But for that, we have got a recommendation as mentioned earlier – Filmora solution.

Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Pro-Tips-Configuring-Stopwatches-in-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Pro-Tips-Configuring-Stopwatches-in-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tips: Configuring Stopwatches in OBS Studio"></a>Pro Tips: Configuring Stopwatches in OBS Studio</h2><p>OBS Studio is arguably the best free, open-source screen recorder for Mac, Windows, and Linux computers. It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known <strong>OBS countdown timer</strong>.</p><p>So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?"></a>Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?</h2><p>You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.</p><p>With that said, you can use the <strong>OBS timer countdown</strong> in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer"                ></p><p>So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.</p><p>Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.</p><p>So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an <strong>OBS count down timer</strong>, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!</p><p>Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name. For instance, you can name it Timer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-2.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add a text source"                ></p><p>Step2 Now you’ll see a pop-up window to customize how the timer will look. For example, click the Select font button to customize the font settings for the countdown timer. You can also customize things like opacity, gradient, background color, alignment, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-3.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer customize timer details"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, click the Tools tab and then tap Scripts. Then, select the countdown.lua file and customize the countdown descriptions on the pop-up window. You can change the countdown duration and the final text after the countdown. Don’t also forget to select Timer as the Text Source. The OBS countdown timer will immediately start counting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-4.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add the timer file"                ></p><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer"></a>Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer</h2><p>You’ll definitely need precise timing to get the most out of the <strong>timer countdown on OBS</strong>. Also, sometimes you can record a video on your smartphone or camera and customize it with a countdown timer. If that’s the case, consider using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s a professional-grade video editor for macOS and Windows systems that allows you to add countdown timer overlays to any video. Unlike OBS, this method will enable you to add timer overlays to specific scenes on the footage, including the intro part. Even best is that the countdown timers come in multiple styles, and you can customize the timer with appropriate background audio.</p><p><strong>Steps to create a countdown timer with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Start-a-new-video-project"><a href="#Step1-Start-a-new-video-project" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Start a new video project"></a>Step1 Start a new video project</h5><p>Install and run Filmora on your PC, and start a New Project.
