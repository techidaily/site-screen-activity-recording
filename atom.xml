Zoom’s screen sharing tools can foster your team’s collaboration and make training more effective. That’s why in this article we are going to show you how to share your device’s screen with Zoom.</p><ul><li><a href="#screen_share_different_devices">Part 1: How to Share the Screen During Zoom Meeting on iPhone&#x2F;Android&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Desktop</a></li><li><a href="#share_multiple_screens">Part 2: How to Share Multiple Screens with Zoom?</a></li><li><a href="#zoom_screen_sharing_faq">Part 3: Zoom Screen Sharing Troubleshooting</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Share-the-Screen-on-Different-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Share-the-Screen-on-Different-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Share the Screen on Different Devices"></a>How to Share the Screen on Different Devices</h2><p>Each version of Zoom features screen sharing tools, although the exact steps you will have to take in order to share your screen with your colleagues depend on the version of Zoom you are using. Moreover, you must also make sure that Zoom is compatible with the OS that is installed on your device before you can start using this video conferencing app. Here’s how you can share screens on different devices.</p><h3 id="1-Sharing-the-Screen-with-Zoom-from-the-Web-Browser"><a href="#1-Sharing-the-Screen-with-Zoom-from-the-Web-Browser" class="headerlink" title="1.

Sharing the Screen with Zoom from the Web Browser</h3><p>Zoom web client offers the option to join meetings or share screens directly from the web browser, without prior installation of the application on your computer or your Smartphone.

Clicking on the upwards arrow that is located next to the Share Screen button will enable you to choose who is going to have access to the screen you shared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-share-permission-options.jpg"                      alt="Share Screen Options on Zoom"                ></p><p>You can only opt to share a screen with all participants of a meeting or with the host while sharing a screen with the participants you select is not an option.</p><p>Want to record the screen sharing on Zoom and watch later in details, check the guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record Zoom Meeting. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Sharing-the-Screen-from-the-iPhone-or-iPad"><a href="#2-Sharing-the-Screen-from-the-iPhone-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="2.

So, if you can’t find the Screen Share button, you should check if the application is compatible with the operating system.</p><p>Furthermore, Windows users who see only a black screen after they share their screen should switch back to the computer’s integrated graphics. You can do this by going to the Windows Control Panel and selecting the graphic card’s control panel.</p><p>Click on the Manage 3D Settings option and then choose I would like to use the following 3D settings from the Program Settings menu. You should then go to the Select a Program to Customize the menu and add the Cphost.exe file from the Zoom Bin directory.</p><p>Proceed to click on the Add Selected Program, choose the Integrated Graphics setting and click on the Apply button. Head back to Zoom and check if the black screen issue is resolved.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Sharing one or more screens during meetings on Zoom is easy, and it won’t take much more than a few moments of your time, regardless of the device you’re using to run this application. However, you should keep in mind that mobile and web-based versions of the app offer only limited capabilities and that only Mac and PC versions of the app enable users to share multiple screens simultaneously.

Learn all the essential elements and steps to record voice over like professionals.</p><p>For every video you come across, the audio part is equally important as the visual part. Even when the visual part is top-notch, if the audio part such as background music and the voice narration is not good enough, you lose interest in the video. Therefore, you have to pay equal attention to the video recording as well as voiceover recording. A voiceover is basically a person speaking in the background as the video is playing along to make proper sense as well as to add more context to the video.</p><p>A voiceover recording can be describing the video, explaining concepts, highlighting important points, and likewise. Generally, a voiceover is added to the video after the video is already recorded. In order to record a good voice over, there are certain essential elements you need to have beforehand. In this article, we will explain why and how to record a voice over and how to make a voice over good to get everyone’s attention and appreciation.</p><h2 id="1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover"><a href="#1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="1. Why To Record A Voiceover?"></a>1. Why To Record A Voiceover?</h2><p>The engagement on a video depends both on how good the video content as well as how good the audio is. The audio in a video is not just about background music. A good voiceover can do wonders in terms of retaining the attention of the viewers as well as showcasing your personality traits.</p><p>A voice over recording is a must when you are making instructional, educational, and informational videos. Imagine watching a tutorial video where there is no voice to explain what is happening on the screen, everyone will leave the video immediately.

Essential elements for a good voice over"></a>2. Essential elements for a good voice over</h2><p>You have to ensure that your voice over recording is great from all perspectives. There are certain essential elements that you have to get right in order to make a voice over mediocre to good and even great.</p><p><strong>Audio Clarity</strong></p><p>Every great voiceover has perfect voice quality and comfortable volume. Audiences may find it distracting if the voiceover recording has a muddy and muffled sound. They will definitely miss the important message that you may want to share through the video. Low volume will make people difficult to hear whereas too loud can cause irritation.</p><p>To ensure audio clarity, professionals use voice over recording studio. If you generally record voice over at home, make sure you do it when there is absolute silence in the background. Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3. How To Record A Voice Over?"></a>3. How To Record A Voice Over?</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to record voiceover properly like professionals.</p><p><strong>Getting Ready</strong></p><ul><li>Location: Look for a quiet place to work. Professional voice artists opt for a soundproof room to cancel out external noise. However, you can even go for a quiet area where there is no distracting noise. Microphones can pick up ambient noise that will be reflected in the voiceover recording. Apart from human conversations, you will also have to be careful of the sound coming from electronic gadgets such as computer fans.</li><li>Microphone: Look for a top-notch microphone as per your budget. Consider using a pop filter if you are going to use an external mic. It helps to reduce the distracting sounds with certain alphabets as well as the sound of breathing. Among affordable microphones, you may use modern earbuds or headphones with mic that you use for your smartphone. There are many USB microphones available in the market at an affordable value.</li><li>Voiceover Recorder Software: You need a good-quality audio recording software to record voiceover as well as edit the recording as per requirement. There are many free as well as premium audio recording software available in the market today. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record voice over for any video like professionals as well as edit the recording of audio and video in the same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing A Proper Script</strong></p><p>The best way to sound professional during a voice over is to use a proper script. When you don’t use a script, then there can be a lot of pauses and you may try to think about what you will have to say next. When you use a script, you have everything planned out beforehand. Besides, you can also practice what to say when you have a script with pointers and even full explanation of each point. Try to read the script many times and be careful of the words and phrases that can be awkward. Adjust the script accordingly so that it will fit perfectly in the recording.</p><p><strong>Performing A Test Recording</strong></p><p>It is always advisable to go for a test recording to ensure that everything is working properly. In a test recording, you don’t have to go for the entire script but just a few paragraphs. Check if the audio is clear, the volume is at the right level, and the recording is seamless. Check the audio quality by using headphones and not computer speakers.</p><p>**<strong>Microphone Placement</strong> - If you keep the microphone too close to the mouth, there will be all kinds of weird sounds including air puffs. Too far placement will make your voice get fainted. The perfect placement should be about 6 to 8 inches from the mouth and it has to be slightly below the chin. Check the test recording carefully as some microphones can pick up sounds from the table and the computer.</p><p><strong>Recording Voice Over</strong></p><p>So by now, you have the video for which you want to record voiceover.

However, there is a lot to consider before choosing your camera.</p><p>This guide critiques and ranks the best gaming webcams to make that choice easier. Some webcams provide great value, while others deliver an unbelievable high-resolution streaming experience. The following are some of the features we looked for in creating this guide:</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in Gaming Webcams"></a>What to Look for in Gaming Webcams</h2><ul><li>Video quality</li><li>Resolution</li><li>Microphone quality</li><li>Price</li><li>Low-light capabilities</li></ul><h2 id="Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have"><a href="#Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have" class="headerlink" title="Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have"></a>Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have</h2><ul><li>1080p resolution</li><li>60FPS</li><li>Stereo Audio</li><li>Ergonomic design</li><li>RealSense capabilities</li><li>Automatic light correction</li><li>Compatibility with both Windows and Mac</li></ul><p>So, without further ado, the following are our 5 favorite webcams for gaming in 2021:</p><h4 id="1-Ontop-HD-Webcam"><a href="#1-Ontop-HD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="1.

It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO" class="headerlink" title="2.

It delivers tremendous <strong>4K Ultra HD recording</strong>, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).</p><p>The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>omnidirectional mics</strong>. It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

The <strong>ring-light camera</strong> is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with <strong>12 different brightness settings,</strong> so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.</p><p>What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)</strong> like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built-in Ring Light</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>No additional features</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam"><a href="#4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="4.

With <strong>1080p full HD video at 30 FPS</strong>, on a <strong>2-megapixel base</strong> and <strong>built-in stereo microphones</strong>, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.</p><p>What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Cost</li><li>Ease of use</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No lighting correction features</li><li>No 60 FPS streaming</li></ul><h4 id="5-Razer-Stargazer"><a href="#5-Razer-Stargazer" class="headerlink" title="5. Razer Stargazer"></a>5. Razer Stargazer</h4><p>The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it’s <strong>fantastic at filtering out ambient noise</strong>.</p><p>If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M" >only $150 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Incredible background removal technology</li><li>Great audio</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Not as good video quality as some of its competitors</li><li>Not compatible with older generation computers</li></ul><p>Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list.

Users may meet face to face, communicate with associates via in-meeting chatting or conference call, &amp; share their presentations via screen sharing.</p><p>Meetings may be accessed via a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device. All GoToMeeting sessions (also known as webinars) can be recorded. This article explains how to record a <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> session in detail, including a step-by-step approach.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record GoToMeeting with an Online Recorder</a></p><p>Part 4. <a href="#part4">Record GoToMeeting on iPhone and Android</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder"></a>Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</h2><p>Meetings can be recorded using the built-in <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> option, but there are limits.</p><p>However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting’s meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.</p><p>Step 1. Just click over the “REC” icon at the top of the GoToMeeting screen once you have joined a meeting to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-start-record.jpg"                      alt="gotomeeting start record"                ></p><p>Step 2. While recording, click “Start Your Recording,” and the “REC” icon will become red. The recording of the meeting will be announced to all participants.</p><p>Step 3. Click over the “REC” icon and choose “Stop Your Recording” to stop the recording. If you’re making a local recording, the Recording Manager will open up and ask you to convert the video. However, if you’re doing a cloud recording, you’ll be sent to your online account to retrieve the footage. It takes some time for new recordings to appear in the cloud recording history.</p><p>Step 4. However, what if other participants, such as not account owners or organizers, wish to record live sessions? In this instance, you’ll need a video-recording program that works on both PCs and Macs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The option to record in GoToMeeting is essential for individuals who cannot attend due to a time difference, a tight schedule, or illness and who need to follow or share the meeting or webinar. Simply follow the easy instructions above to capture your <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> on PC, iOS, or Android.

How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</h2><p>Meetings can be recorded using the built-in <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> option, but there are limits.</p><p>However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting’s meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.</p><p>Step 1. Just click over the “REC” icon at the top of the GoToMeeting screen once you have joined a meeting to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-start-record.jpg"                      alt="gotomeeting start record"                ></p><p>Step 2. While recording, click “Start Your Recording,” and the “REC” icon will become red. The recording of the meeting will be announced to all participants.</p><p>Step 3. Click over the “REC” icon and choose “Stop Your Recording” to stop the recording. If you’re making a local recording, the Recording Manager will open up and ask you to convert the video. However, if you’re doing a cloud recording, you’ll be sent to your online account to retrieve the footage. It takes some time for new recordings to appear in the cloud recording history.</p><p>Step 4. However, what if other participants, such as not account owners or organizers, wish to record live sessions? In this instance, you’ll need a video-recording program that works on both PCs and Macs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151873/7443" target="_top" id="2151873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC-3"><a href="#Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
