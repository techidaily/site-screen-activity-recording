Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they <strong>cannot stop QuickTime screen recording</strong> following the standard procedure.</p><p>When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to QuickTime Player stop screen recording.

It is a professional screen recording and video editing software available for both Mac and Windows users.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/efficient-presentation-recording-with-a-webcam-on-handy-guide-for-2024/"><u>Efficient Presentation  Recording with a Webcam on Handy Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-streamline-your-presence-optimal-obs-use-on-facebook-feed/"><u>In 2024, Streamline Your Presence  Optimal OBS Use on Facebook Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tutorial-turning-on-grid-view-in-google-meet-chats/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Tutorial  Turning On Grid View in Google Meet Chats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-divided-footage-delight-top-cam-discussion/"><u>[New] In 2024, Divided Footage Delight  Top Cam Discussion?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-epitaph-to-entertainment-picking-the-ultimate-zombie-games/"><u>2024 Approved  Epitaph to Entertainment  Picking the Ultimate Zombie Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ideal-tools-for-capturing-your-next-google-meet-success/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Ideal Tools for Capturing Your Next Google Meet Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-master-the-art-of-seamless-video-compatibility/"><u>2024 Approved  Master the Art of Seamless Video Compatibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-persistent-display-transcription-for-2024/"><u>[New] Persistent Display Transcription for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-obs-studio-wizards-top-5-secrets-to-unmatched-quality-for-2024/"><u>[New] OBS Studio Wizards  Top 5 Secrets to Unmatched Quality for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-the-simple-steps-to-update-your-networks-banner-image/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unveiling the Simple Steps to Update Your Network's Banner Image</u></a></li><li><a href="https://meme-emoji.techidaily.com/new-best-10-emoji-makers-to-create-your-own-emojis-pconlineandroidiphone-for-2024/"><u>New Best 10 Emoji Makers to Create Your Own Emojis PC/Online/Android/iPhone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/best-gopro-accessories-for-beginners-for-2024/"><u>Best GoPro Accessories for Beginners for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-understanding-igtv-from-basics-to-advanced-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[New] Understanding IGTV  From Basics to Advanced Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-complete-capture-master-az-reviews-and-backups/"><u>[New] In 2024, Complete Capture Master - AZ Reviews & Backups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-android-app-not-installed-error-on-nubia-z50-ultra-quickly-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Android App Not Installed Error on Nubia Z50 Ultra Quickly? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-update-or-downgrade-apple-iphone-se-without-losing-data-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Update or Downgrade Apple iPhone SE Without Losing Data? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-flashframe-crafter/"><u>[New] In 2024, FlashFrame Crafter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/tutorial-turning-on-grid-view-in-google-meet-chats-for-2024/"><u>Tutorial  Turning On Grid View in Google Meet Chats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-compelling-spotify-campaigns-a-practical-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting Compelling Spotify Campaigns  A Practical Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s nearly impossible to dispute the sheer quantity and quality of gameplay options within the 30th Anniversary Collection, which include fighters that helped shape the genre, such as Street Fighter II Turbo and arguably the greatest fighting games of all time, such as Street Fighter III: Third Strike.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Street Fighter classics ported to the arcade</p><p>• Fans will find a variety of bonus materials</p><p>• A great choice for competitive play</p><h3 id="2-Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate"><a href="#2-Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate" class="headerlink" title="2.Super Smash Bros.

Featuring over 80 playable characters, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the latest entry in the series and the largest crossover yet.

While this Dragon Ball title might be a good introduction to the genre, veterans can also enjoy it. As in the comics and on-screen side of this universe, this title’s visual style perfectly fits the fans’ expectations. This game has recognizable moves, an extensive roster of warriors, and a pace that matches the speed these lethal soldiers should possess in battle.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Bringing Dragon Ball Z mayhem to life</p><p>• The visuals are stunning</p><p>• It’s fast and fun to play tag team</p><p>• Overall a great game to enjoy</p><h3 id="4-King-Of-Fighters-‘98"><a href="#4-King-Of-Fighters-‘98" class="headerlink" title="4.King Of Fighters ‘98 "></a>4.King Of Fighters ‘98 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/king-of-fighters-98-poster.jpg"                      alt="king-of-fighters-98-poster"                ></h3><p>King of Fighters is a fighting game franchise developed by a legendary game developer, SNK, with more than fifteen entries spanning nearly thirty years. Nearly every King of Fighters entry is currently available as a footsies-focused fighter that lets players create teams of characters. A notable exception is King of Fighters ‘98, which many have praised as the best entry in the series because it is incredibly polished and refined.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• A lot of versatile characters available to choose from</p><p>• Best action and fighting environment</p><p>• Despite being released more than two decades ago, the game still presents the same level of excitement and thrill</p><h3 id="5-Mortal-Kombat-11"><a href="#5-Mortal-Kombat-11" class="headerlink" title="5.Mortal Kombat 11 "></a>5.Mortal Kombat 11 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mortal-kombat-11-poster.jpg"                      alt="mortal-kombat-11-poster"                ></h3><p>In recent years, the Mortal Kombat series has grown in stature, and with HBO’s movie reboot coming soon, Mortal Kombat 11 on Nintendo Switch might be a good time to revisit it. The game uses the Switch platform well, even though it is not exclusive to the console.</p><p>The narrative in this game, along with its diverse roster and some of its surprises, has been praised. Even those with the Switch have access to this incredible game. This game may be the measuring stick for every other game in its genre.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The game presents the best cinematics</p><p>• On Switch, you can play this game at 60 fps</p><p>• The decent character rooster makes it even more interesting</p><p>• It is fun and enjoyable to play the game with each character’s unique abilities</p><h3 id="6-Power-Rangers-Battle-For-The-Grid"><a href="#6-Power-Rangers-Battle-For-The-Grid" class="headerlink" title="6.Power Rangers: Battle For The Grid "></a>6.Power Rangers: Battle For The Grid <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/power-rangers-poster.png"                      alt="power-rangers-poster"                ></h3><p>Bringing the two Japanese icons Nintendo &amp; Power Rangers, together is a feat to be celebrated. Fans are praising the game’s range of heroes from the beloved franchise, with its fast-paced gameplay working well on handheld devices.</p><p>Even though the game uses a tag-team mechanic that few others use, its gameplay is just as captivating as the show, despite the occasional shaky sound design. In terms of the use of complicated maneuvers, there are both simple and complex aspects to learn, but fans of the genre and brand should be interested in this game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• One of the best combat games that you might be missing out</p><p>• The game offers dynamic graphics</p><p>• Pretty simple controls with easy to learn functionality</p><h3 id="7-Streets-Of-Rage-4"><a href="#7-Streets-Of-Rage-4" class="headerlink" title="7.Streets Of Rage 4 "></a>7.Streets Of Rage 4 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streets-of-rage-4-poster.png"                      alt="streets-of-rage-4-poster"                ></h3><p>Although the game is available on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation as well, the Switch manages to give players a more immersive experience than those platforms. In this new generation of games, a franchise more than two decades old is brought back to its roots with updated graphics.</p><p>Although the mechanics are similar in a way, this is more like a return to a side-scrolling era, while many other titles utilize an arena matchup style of gameplay. Whether it’s the intense gameplay itself or the energetic campaign, players will continue to come back to the game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Better gameplay experience as compared to other consoles</p><p>• Intense gameplay</p><p>• One of the best fighting games to play on Switch</p><h3 id="8-Naruto-Shippuden-Ultimate-Ninja-Storm-Trilogy"><a href="#8-Naruto-Shippuden-Ultimate-Ninja-Storm-Trilogy" class="headerlink" title="8.Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Trilogy "></a>8.Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Trilogy <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-poster.jpg"                      alt="naruto-shippuden-ultimate-poster"                ></h3><p>The fan response to Naruto titles has been varied, and yet this new three-pack delivers all three games to the Nintendo Switch with updated graphics and all of the downloadable content. In the end, you’ll have a title that satisfies every fan of the franchise.</p><p>More so, the 3D style of gameplay develops in the series, which is quite refreshing in comparison to some of the 2D scroller games. A gripping story and a few unique combos make this a great game for those players who enjoy ongoing campaigns.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Naruto Lovers will definitely enjoy this game</p><p>• Best gameplay</p><p>• Extra-Ordinary graphics make it worth playing</p><h3 id="9-Kirby-Fighters-2"><a href="#9-Kirby-Fighters-2" class="headerlink" title="9.Kirby Fighters 2 "></a>9.Kirby Fighters 2 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kirby-fighters-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="kirby-fighters-2-poster"                ></h3><p>While Kirby is likely to appear in Super Smash Bros, why is one enough when there are nearly two dozen? Kirby comes in all kinds of styles, including one called Wrestler and one named Bell. Their gameplay is all different.</p><p>A simple title like Kirby Fighters 2 can be enjoyed by families. As well as featuring iconic Nintendo locations and Meta Knight, the game features some other well-known characters from the Kirby franchise. Nintendo Switch is lucky to have this classic title, which really celebrates the company and genre.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Best game to be played by families</p><p>• Although it may seem simple, the gameplay is intense</p><p>•A lot of characters to choose from</p><h3 id="10-Arms"><a href="#10-Arms" class="headerlink" title="10.Arms "></a>10.Arms <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/arms-poster.jpg"                      alt="arms-poster"                ></h3><p>With this exclusive title from Nintendo, you’ll get both a boxing game and a party game. This is an incredibly wacky game in every imaginable sense, with its colorful visuals giving a hint of the fun to be had.</p><p>Despite its chaos, it’s relatively easy to participate. Fighting arenas in these games are characterized by their enormous boxing gloves and stretching arms, with players facing off in a wide variety of locations, yet somewhat uninspired. As for the balance, other games in the genre suffer from the same frustrations as this one does.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Convenient controls and simple concept</p><p>• It plays easily with little effort</p><p>• Younger gamers will enjoy this game because it isn’t violent</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>In this article, we shared a list of some best Nintendo switch fighting games with you.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Nightscape-Notables-Tips-for-Capturing-Starlit-Portraits"><a href="#Nightscape-Notables-Tips-for-Capturing-Starlit-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Nightscape Notables: Tips for Capturing Starlit Portraits"></a>Nightscape Notables: Tips for Capturing Starlit Portraits</h2><p>It has been seen that most portrait photography is carried out during the daytime as this is the time that offers the best light. However, diverging from regular practice can sometimes lead to creative and interesting results.</p><p>Well, <strong>night-mode portraits</strong> can be such an opportunity. However, it can be a little challenging for you. Night portrait shoots require the photographer to manipulate shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and more. Besides, there are certain dos and don’ts that you also need to keep in mind. Keep reading to know more about this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/night-potraits.jpg"                      alt="night potraits"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-1-Must-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 1: Must-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><p>Let’s start this discussion by exploring the major dos related to <strong>night portraits</strong> photoshoots. Some dos that you should consider are:</p><h3 id="1-Shooting-with-a-topic"><a href="#1-Shooting-with-a-topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Shooting with a topic"></a>1. Shooting with a topic</h3><p>One of the most difficult repercussions of <strong>night mode portraits</strong> is that everything in your sight takes on a strange appeal, which can easily make it challenging to understand the composition and picture subject. Well, to avoid such an issue, you need to make yourself familiarized with your topic or subject. So, you can arrive at the location before sunset and begin the setup procedure.</p><p>This will also allow you to take advantage of clicking pictures during special hour lighting. Besides, it will also help you to know how changing list settings can affect the scene. Another important thing to consider here is styling your subject. You need to make sure that your subjects look professional and choose the right type of clothing. So, try to understand the purpose of your <strong>night mode portraits.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Lighting-your-Subject"><a href="#2-Lighting-your-Subject" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting your Subject"></a>2. Lighting your Subject</h3><p>While shooting <strong>night portraits,</strong> based on the location, you may not get sufficient natural light to light up the subject. This is where you need to use some types of artificial lighting. Without this, you may not be able to capture the details of your subject. Your shots will look very blurry and underexposed. Well, artificial lighting need not be a flash. The source of artificial lighting can be anything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-matheus-bertelli-573298.jpg"                      alt="pexels matheus bertelli 573298"                ></p><p>For example, it can be a car light, a phone flashlight, a billboard light and anything that can light up the subject, offering a decent amount of illumination to your camera. Make sure that the light is accessible. Experts suggest using off-camera flashlights for <strong>night portraits</strong> as it offers better flexibility. Based on your requirements, you can adjust the direction and brightness. Using a light stand can also be very helpful here.</p><h3 id="3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait"><a href="#3-Make-Good-Use-of-Night-Mode-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait"></a>3. Make Good Use of Night Mode Portrait</h3><p>Don’t forget to take advantage of your camera’s night mode portrait option to get stunning results. Sometimes, you need to depend on software instead of your camera’s hardware for better results. Post-processing can enhance the exposure, level colors, effectively tune white balance, etc., and night mode can help you with that. When you choose this option, the camera will consider different factors, like the movement of the subjects, camera, light settings and more.</p><p>The camera will then take a series of photos at multiple exposure levels and then merge them to create a single image with great details. Even though <strong>night mode portraits</strong> can help you a lot, they may not work well while taking photos of moving objects. The reason behind this is that this mode takes multiple shots, and moving subjects would be blurred out. If it is a static scene, then go for it.</p><h3 id="4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer"><a href="#4-Shooting-with-a-Stabilizer" class="headerlink" title="4. Shooting with a Stabilizer"></a>4. Shooting with a Stabilizer</h3><p>For better results, you can use a camera stabilizer. A camera stabilizer will offer you the ability to take beautiful and smooth shots while moving. Stabilizers come in different configurations and sizes. They can effectively lower the vibration of the camera while moving. But shooting with a monopod, gimbal, or other rigs can be a little challenging for you. However, there are some tips that you can keep in your mind for better results, for example:</p><ul><li>Always try to maintain a perfect distance from the subject.</li><li>Use wheels.</li><li>You can also use electronic panning.</li><li>Walk carefully.</li><li>Close down the aperture.</li><li>Allow your subject to move into the focus distance.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-marcelo-dias-1970482.jpg"                      alt="pexels marcelo dias 1970482"                ></p><p>Experts suggest using a sturdy camera tripod, and it will be better to get a remote release. With this, you can trigger the camera without touching the shutter button, and it will reduce the movement of the camera.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits"><a href="#Part-2-Don’t-Dos-in-Night-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits"></a>Part 2: Don’t-Dos in Night Portraits</h2><h3 id="1-Don’t-dress-in-dark"><a href="#1-Don’t-dress-in-dark" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t dress in dark"></a>1. Don’t dress in dark</h3><p>When it comes to wearing black for night portraits, experts suggest avoiding it unless you have proper light settings and you have your make-up done by an expert who can correct the color for shadows. Sometimes, dark clothes may create an aging effect on the subject. Besides, if the lighting condition is not good, the photos will become much darker due to your dark dress. So, wear light-colored dresses. Besides, don’t use shirts that have visible text, brand names or logos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-nikolai-ulltang-572463.jpg"                      alt="pexels nikolai ulltang 572463"                ></p><h3 id="2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot"><a href="#2-Don’t-do-a-capture-shoot" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t do a capture shoot"></a>2. Don’t do a capture shoot</h3><p>Most photographers use single shooting mode or go for the capture shoot in many cases. That could be the manual mode, and sometimes it is done to adjust the shutter and aperture manually. During night shooting, some photographers use higher ISO. This means the lens will allow more light to come in. As a result, it can create a smear while capturing a moving object. But in some cases, using continuous shooting can help you to capture some of the best moments for <strong>night portraits.</strong> If you are shooting in a fast-paced scenario, then this can help you a lot. You may not use all the images you have captured, but you can find perfect portraits.</p><h3 id="3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture"><a href="#3-Don’t-Overuse-Light-The-Right-Shutter-Speed-ISO-and-Aperture" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture"></a>3. Don’t Overuse Light- The Right Shutter Speed, ISO and Aperture</h3><p>Another thing you need to avoid here is the overuse of light. You need to work on the primary exposure settings, i.e., the ISO, aperture and shutter speed. You should keep in mind that these three configurations will create exposure and influence the photos’ overall brightness. One thing to consider while choosing the setting is to have a photo with a lot of detail in the mid-tones, highlights, and shadows.</p><p>When you overuse the light, it can affect the scene’s depth of field. Besides, the sharpness of the subject will also get affected by this. To control the light, you need to choose the aperture based on the depth of field. For example, for a shallow effect, you can go for a wide aperture, like f&#x2F;2.8. You can use a narrower aperture, like f&#x2F;8, for a sharper background.</p><p>Talking about the shutter speed, for stationary subjects, you can go for 1&#x2F;160s. If it is a moving subject, then 1&#x2F;500s or above can work for you. Now, coming to the ISO, the default ISO value, i.e., ISO 100, is good for taking the highest-quality photos. If you think your portraits are overexposed, then increase the shutter speed to control the light.</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting"><a href="#4-Don’t-forget-about-white-balance-and-Adjust-It-Before-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting"></a>4. Don’t forget about white balance and Adjust It Before Shooting</h3><p>Speaking about white balance, it is a setting to make sure the colors in the photos are natural and accurate and the photos don’t have unrealistic colors. If the subject appears white in real but blue or red in the photos, then you need to adjust the white balance. Daylight white balance will be very warm for night photos. That’s why you need to go for cooler settings, around 3200 to 4800, based on your environment and location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pexels-simon-robben-473107.jpg"                      alt="pexels simon robben 473107"                ></p><p>For example, in city areas, a lower setting, i.e., 3400 to 3900k, can work great. On the other hand, for darker skies, white balance settings of 4000k and above will offer you the best results. Begin with the above suggestion and click some test photos while increasing 100k after every shot to find the right white balance settings.</p><p>However, you can also preset the white balance in your camera or edit the photos during post-processing to adjust the white balance. For example, you can use color correction to fix colors. Using this, you can make the photos look brighter or darker to make them appear natural and realistic. Always use a vector scope to make sure that your colors are accurate.</p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-To-Capture-Good-Portraits-at-Night"><a href="#How-To-Capture-Good-Portraits-at-Night" class="headerlink" title="How To Capture Good Portraits at Night?"></a>How To Capture Good Portraits at Night?</h3><p>As per the experts, the lower the aperture, the more light your camera will receive. This can make your <strong>night mode portraits</strong> difficult. So, you need to go for a slower shutter speed and make sure that there will be subject or camera movement. All you need to do is control the light.</p><h3 id="What-Should-You-Need-to-Avoid-in-Portrait-Photography"><a href="#What-Should-You-Need-to-Avoid-in-Portrait-Photography" class="headerlink" title="What Should You Need to Avoid in Portrait Photography?"></a>What Should You Need to Avoid in Portrait Photography?</h3><p>Some common mistakes that you need to avoid while shooting portraits are poor lighting, poor composition, bad background, using the incorrect lens, not properly focusing on the eyes, overexposure and more.

Besides, utilizing long camera shutter speeds, around 30 seconds to 60 seconds, will be good. Sometimes, using auto-white balance, you can get great results.

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere4"                ></p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Creating such amazing things and sharing them on your social media and video sharing platforms can get you a lot of audience and views.
