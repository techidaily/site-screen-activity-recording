The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.</li><li>The sound quality is excellent.</li><li>As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.</li><li>Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Mednafen"><a href="#3-Mednafen" class="headerlink" title="3.Mednafen"></a>3.Mednafen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png"                      alt="mednafen-poster-ps1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator. Users can remap hotkeys and virtual system inputs to joysticks or keyboards, or both simultaneously. Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.</p><p>The majority of Mednafen’s cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier. For example, MedLaunch offers a dynamic games library with DAT lookup and online scraping and the ability to configure controllers.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multi-platform emulation allows games to be played on PlayStation One as well as other gaming consoles.</li><li>Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.</li><li>Providing you have the right PlayStation BIOS and ROM, it can be set up quickly and easily.</li><li>The Mednafen emulator supports the use of game cheats.</li></ul><h3 id="4-ePSXe"><a href="#4-ePSXe" class="headerlink" title="4.ePSXe"></a>4.ePSXe</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/epsxe-ps1-poster.png"                      alt="epsxe-ps1-poster"                ></p><p>You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program. It is just a matter of copying the BIOS file from your console, setting up the controller, and customizing the keys.</p><p>Gameplay usually runs smoothly without much configuration and trial-and-error. When your game doesn’t load or you experience lags, you can fix it by applying an ePSXe patch (in .ppf format).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>This software provides a close analogous experience to playing video games on the PlayStation One itself, but on a personal computer.</li><li>Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.</li><li>It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.</li><li>Dual-player and split-screen modes are available.

The process of converting a PPT file into a video file in PowerPoint 2007 may not be as simple as on the latest version of the software, but it is far from being complicated. Please note that if you have a 2013 PowerPoint and you want to save a PPT file created on the 2007 version of the software you can do so by clicking on the Create a Video option. Here’s how you can convert a PowerPoint presentation to video if you are still using PowerPoint 2007.</p><p>Before you proceed any further you’ll have to make sure that you have <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> installed on your PC. Afterward, you should save each slide you included in your presentation as an image file, preferably in the JPG file format. You can do this by clicking on the File menu. then opening the Save As submenu and choosing the Other Formats option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-ppt-to-video-ms2007.jpg"                      alt="Save PPT to Videos"                ></p><p>When all the slides are saved as images, you should launch the Windows Movie Maker and import all images you previously created in PowerPoint. If you want to include narration in your PowerPoint video, you can import the audio file directly into the Windows Movie Maker and add it to your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-ppt-to-video-ms2007-windows-movie-maker.jpg"                      alt="Save PPT to Videos"                ></p><p>This method of saving a PowerPoint presentation as a video doesn’t allow you to keep animations, transitions or multimedia files, because you have to convert all slides into image files.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Saving-PowerPoint-2010-Presentation-as-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Saving-PowerPoint-2010-Presentation-as-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Saving PowerPoint 2010 Presentation as Video"></a>Part 2: Saving PowerPoint 2010 Presentation as Video</h2><p>Unlike the previous version of the software, PowerPoint 2010 actually features an option that enables you to convert the PPT file into a video file format. Unfortunately, you can only save videos as WMV files, that have some major downsides.

The only difference is that on recent versions of the software you can save the video in MP4 file format that is better suited for online distribution than the WMV file format. Here’s how you can convert PPT to video in PowerPoint 2013.</p><p>Collapse the File menu and select the Export option, then click on the Create a Video feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ppt-save-as-video.jpg"                      alt="Save PPT to Videos"                ></p><p>Once the Create a Video window emerges on the screen, you should click on the Computer and HD Displays option, so you can adjust the video quality and size settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ppt-save-as-video-settings.jpg"                      alt="Save PPT to Videos"                ></p><p>After fine-tuning the video settings, you can proceed to click on the Use Recorded Timings and Narrations menu. If you don’t want to include narration or recorded timings in your video, you can set the duration of each slide individually with the Timings feature that is located at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ppt-save-as-video-timings-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Save PPT to Videos "                ></p><p>Hitting the Create a Video button will bring up the Save As window that will enable you to name the video file, select the location of the folder where the video file will be saved and choose the file format to which you want to convert the PPT file.

The Mac version of PowerPoint doesn’t allow you to include multimedia, transitions or animations in your videos, and for that reason, it is important to remove all such content from the presentation before you start the conversion process.

The limited output formats PowerPoint currently provides remain the main reason to use third-party apps such as Wondershare PPT to Video Pro that let you choose the video file format that best suits the demands of the project you’re working on.</p><p>Which method of converting PPT to video files do you like to use the most?

The limit of 100 participants can be increased to 300 and 1000 with the paid Business and Enterprise Plus subscription plans respectively.</p><p>Going further, this guide explains in detail how to set up a Zoom call or conference, and how to make the entire meeting session simplified and more useful by making minor adjustments to the app. Besides, you will also learn how to set up a Zoom meeting in Outlook and Google Calendar, or how to schedule Zoom meetings for the future.</p><ul><li><a href="#set_up_zoom_meeting">Part 1: How to Set Up Zoom Meeting</a></li><li><a href="#zoom_meeting_setup_tips">Part 2: Tips for Better Zoom Meeting Setup</a></li><li><a href="#zoom_meeting_schedule">Part 3: Schedule and Set Up a Zoom Meeting for the Future</a></li><li><a href="#zoom_meeting_google_calendar">Part 4: How to Set Up Zoom Meetings on Google Calendar</a></li><li><a href="#zoom_meeting_outlook">Part 5: Set Up a Zoom Meeting in Outlook</a></li></ul><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-call/best-video-conference-app-android-iphone.html" >8 Best Video Conference App for Android and iPhone (Picked) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Set-Up-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Set-Up-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Set Up Zoom Meeting"></a>Part 1: How to Set Up Zoom Meeting</h2><p>The good news is, if you are merely a participant of a Zoom meeting that has been hosted by someone else, you don’t necessarily need to download and install the app. You can join the conference by following the URL using your favorite web browser, and typing in the meeting ID and password you are provided with via email or any other method chosen by the host.</p><p>On the other hand, if it’s you who is hosting a conference (in other words, starting a conference and want to invite others to join the meeting), Zoom must be installed on your device.</p><p>You can learn how to set up a Zoom meeting right from the scratch by following the steps given below:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Download-and-Install-Zoom"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-Install-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Download and Install Zoom"></a>Step 1: Download and Install Zoom</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-zoom-meeting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Download"                ></p><p>Launch your favorite web browser (Mozilla Firefox here) on your computer (a Windows 10 PC is used here), go to <a class="link"   href="https://zoom.us/download" >https://zoom.us/download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Download</strong>, and follow the on-screen instructions to download Zoom to your local hard drive.

Next, type the participants’ IDs in the <strong>Invite attendees</strong> field (the IDs must be added to your Microsoft Outlook account’s contact list before they can be added here), and click <strong>Save</strong> from the top-right corner to schedule a Zoom meeting.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The process of how to set up a Zoom meeting is simple, and to learn how to set up a Zoom meeting in Outlook is even simpler. However, for the latter you need to install an add-in that is freely available from the vendor’s official website. Same is the case when you want to use Google Calendar to set up and&#x2F;or schedule a Zoom meeting with the participants. To conclude, being one of the cheapest solutions (i.e. free in most scenarios) for virtual business meetings and video conferences, Zoom is appreciated by almost all the corporate professionals around the globe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Perfect-Emulators-to-Replay-PlayStation-1-Classics"><a href="#Perfect-Emulators-to-Replay-PlayStation-1-Classics" class="headerlink" title="Perfect Emulators to Replay PlayStation 1 Classics"></a>Perfect Emulators to Replay PlayStation 1 Classics</h2><p>Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001. The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.</li><li>The sound quality is excellent.</li><li>As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.</li><li>Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Mednafen"><a href="#3-Mednafen" class="headerlink" title="3.Mednafen"></a>3.Mednafen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png"                      alt="mednafen-poster-ps1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator. Users can remap hotkeys and virtual system inputs to joysticks or keyboards, or both simultaneously. Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.</p><p>The majority of Mednafen’s cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier. For example, MedLaunch offers a dynamic games library with DAT lookup and online scraping and the ability to configure controllers.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multi-platform emulation allows games to be played on PlayStation One as well as other gaming consoles.</li><li>Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.</li><li>Providing you have the right PlayStation BIOS and ROM, it can be set up quickly and easily.</li><li>The Mednafen emulator supports the use of game cheats.</li></ul><h3 id="4-ePSXe"><a href="#4-ePSXe" class="headerlink" title="4.ePSXe"></a>4.ePSXe</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/epsxe-ps1-poster.png"                      alt="epsxe-ps1-poster"                ></p><p>You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program. It is just a matter of copying the BIOS file from your console, setting up the controller, and customizing the keys.</p><p>Gameplay usually runs smoothly without much configuration and trial-and-error. When your game doesn’t load or you experience lags, you can fix it by applying an ePSXe patch (in .ppf format).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>This software provides a close analogous experience to playing video games on the PlayStation One itself, but on a personal computer.</li><li>Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.</li><li>It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.</li><li>Dual-player and split-screen modes are available.

If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.</li><li>The sound quality is excellent.</li><li>As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.</li><li>Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Mednafen-3"><a href="#3-Mednafen-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Mednafen"></a>3.Mednafen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png"                      alt="mednafen-poster-ps1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22889392&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://webstatic.nero.com/nero2015-com-wAssets/img/affiliate/media/banner728-90eng.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge.

Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window. You can play the video directly from the Lollipop Screen recorder or you can share it to your Gmail account directly from the app. If you don’t like the screen recording you made, you can tap on the Delete button and start a new session.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Amazingly easy to use and it lets you capture videos in Portrait and Landscape modes.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lollipop Screen Recorder can only capture screens in the device’s native resolution, and it doesn’t provide any customization options.</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Find out more video recorders for Android Phones and Tablets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><hr><h2 id="Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen"></a>Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen</h2><p>Using an app to record the screen of your Android smartphone is just one method in which this task can be accomplished.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t record video with older android devices.<br>In such cases you can use android SDK to mirror the device’s display and record it using a desktop screen-capture software. Mirroring Software will enable you to record the screen on an Android device without rooting. You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare MirrorGo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software to mirror cast the screen from your mobile phone to a display on your computer.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps.
