They look very nice, right. You can also make such game streaming videos by yourself, thanks to Filmora’s latest AI Portrait feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-poster.jpg"                      alt="game-streaming-poster"                ></p><p>There is a huge competition on Youtube for the game streaming category. If you want to stand out from the crowd and make your mark on viewers’ minds, you have to make videos unique and different from all those streamers. One of the best ways to make your game streaming videos stunning and cool is to remove the background of your footage on the corner.</p><p>If you are going to do it traditionally, you will need so many materials like a green background sheet, a stand to hold that sheet, and more. But with Fimlora’s AI Portrait feature, there is no need to purchase all these things. AI Portrait uses Artificial Intelligence to detect the human in the video and separate it from the background for you, saving you a lot of time and effort. It will help remove the background but you can also add various effects like border, glitches, and more. It will not only make your video stand out but it will also help your cover less area of the videos.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a Reaction Video Quickly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make Thumbnail For Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Game-Streaming-Video-Step-by-Step"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Game-Streaming-Video-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Game Streaming Video [Step by Step]"></a>How to Make a Game Streaming Video [Step by Step]</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/store/secure.png"                      alt="Filmora secure download"                > Secure Download</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/store/secure.png"                      alt="Filmora secure download"                > Secure Download</p><p>Using AI Portrait doesn’t require any kind of technical skills or expertise. One can easily apply the AI Portrait effect with a single click. So, let’s get started with the step-by-step guide. Make sure you have already recorded your gameplay and your own video. If not, record it first to process with the following steps.</p><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> Open Filmora X. If it is not already installed on your PC, you can download it from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install it on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step1.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> Import your Gameplay and your own video into the Filmora by clicking on the import button or by dragging the media into Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step2.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 03:</strong> Drag both of these footages into the timeline. Make sure to place your self-recording above the gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step3.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 04:</strong> Select your self-recording and click on effects. Go to the AI Portraits. It shows all the AI Portrait effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step4.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 05:</strong> Since we want to remove the background of our video, drag the “Human Segmentation” effect into the footage to apply it. You can easily purchase it from here. It will ask you to purchase it if you haven’t purchased it already.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step5.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 06:</strong> Once it is applied to the footage, it will separate the background from the character and remove the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step6.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 07:</strong> Adjust the footage by making it smaller and moving to the lower-left corner of the screen. We are good to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step7.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 08:</strong> If in some part of the video you want to show something covered by the character, you can easily change the character’s position using keyframes for a smooth movement. To make sure the character footage is selected, pause the video when you want to change the position of the character and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step8.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 09:</strong> It will automatically add a keyframe. Now move forward into the timeline, drag the character’s position to your preferred position, and hit OK. It will move the character from the old position to the new position smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step9.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> If you want to move the character to the same position, move forward into the timeline and drag it to the same position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step10.png"                      alt="game-streaming-with-ai-portrait-step10"                ></p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>After following and applying all the steps, your game streaming video is ready to be uploaded on Youtube or any other video-sharing platform.

So, chatting with friends, families, and colleagues has now become easier.</p><ul><li>Calls between iOS and Android</li></ul><p> You can stay connected with people irrespective of the device you are using. It is because you can install Google Duo on your tablet, phones, or even chat via the web.</p><ul><li>Low light mode</li></ul><p> The small light mode feature helps you to enjoy the best video calling experience, even when there is less light. For example, if you are trying to chat with people during the evening or nighttime, this is effective.</p><ul><li>Video Messaging</li></ul><p> Suppose you are busy at the moment, and cannot accept a video call request. Just send a custom message along with fun effects through the video messaging tool.</p><ul><li>Voice Calling</li></ul><p> There are times when a video call is not possible. Don’t worry because Google Duo also supports voice-only calls.</p><h3 id="2-WhatsApp-Messenger"><a href="#2-WhatsApp-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="2.

Apart from playing offline videos, VLC Media Player lets you stream videos from online sources as well as convert videos into different file formats. Besides, there are graphics equalizer and audio normalization available. But one feature that clearly stands out is <strong>VLC rotate video</strong> and save the video file.</p><p>You can rotate a video in VLC clockwise at 90, 180, and 270 degrees. The player also allows you to rotate videos at any arbitrary angle as per your requirement. In fact, you can flip the video horizontally and vertically as well as transpose the video as per your preference. Transposing a video means you are flipping and rotating at the same time. Rotating video in VLC is super easy, and in this article, we will explain the steps in detail.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">How to Make the Rotation Permanent</a></p><p>Part 4. <a href="#part4">Alternative Way to Rotate Videos Permanently</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Video Editor"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Rotate, crop, split videos easily.</p><p>Green screen, motion tracking, key framing features</p><p>Audio ducking, slience detection</p><p>Embeded with rich video templates and resources</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Windows"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows"></a>Part 1. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows</h2><p>There are various reasons why you may want to rotate a video. It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective. The most common reason is that the video is taken in portrait mode and it looks small on your computer screen with black screen on both sides and you want to rotate the video to landscape mode. Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Media &gt; Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.</p><p>Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools &gt; Effects and Filters option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-tools-option.jpg"                      alt="vlc tools option"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Adjustments and Effects window, go to Video Effects tab.</p><p>Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.</p><p>Step 6: Check Transform option and from the drop-down menu, select the required options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-adjustments-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc adjustments and effects"                ></p><p>The options available are – rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, flip horizontally or vertically, transport and anti-transpose.</p><p>Step 7: If you want to rotate the video at any desired angle, you can check Rotate option and select the desired angle from the dial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc video effects"                ></p><p>Step 8: Finally, click on Save button and then on Close button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-rotated-video-vlc.jpg"                      alt="save rotated video vlc"                ></p><p>Now, you will get to see the video as per your selected angle instantly. But note that this VLC rotate effect will stay with VLC and if you open any other video file, it will also be displayed as per your selected angle. In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac"></a>Part 2. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac</h2><p>The process of VLC Media Player rotate video is slightly different on Mac as compared to Windows. Here are the steps to follow to rotate video on VLC temporarily.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player. Go to File &gt; Open File option to open the video file that you want to rotate.</p><p>Step 2: Once you have opened the file, go to Window menu option.</p><p>Step 3: From the menu, select Video Effects option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects-mac.jpg"                      alt="vlc video effects mac"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Video Effects window, check Transform option.</p><p>Step 5: From the drop-down menu, select the option as per your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-rotation-options.jpg"                      alt="vlc rotation"                ></p><p>The options available are - rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. Besides, you can flip horizontally or vertically.</p><p>Step 6: Once done, just close Video Effects window and the changes will get saved automatically.</p><p>Just like Windows, this rotation will automatically apply to all the videos you open thereafter. Therefore, you have to repeat the steps and uncheck Transform option to undo the rotation effect.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-the-Rotation-Permanent"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-the-Rotation-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Make the Rotation Permanent"></a>Part 3. How to Make the Rotation Permanent</h2><p>The previous methods of VLC player rotate video on Windows and Mac will not save the video in that rotated angle as displayed. This means if you rotate a video in VLC using the method we have mentioned above, you will see the rotated video momentarily. But if you open the video in another media player or VLC without rotation settings turned off, the video will be playing at the original angle. If you want VLC rotate video and save feature so that the video’s rotation angle changes permanently, take the following steps on Windows.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC player and open the video file.</p><p>Step 2: Follow all the steps we have mentioned on Method 1 - How to rotate video in VLC on Windows?</p><p>Step 3: Thereafter, go to Tool menu and select Preferences option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-preferences.jpg"                      alt="vlc preferences"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148634/16836" target="_top" id="2148634">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148634" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="80" height="31"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148634/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 4: Under Advanced Preferences option, go to Video &gt; Filters option from the left menu.</p><p>Step 5: Check Video transformation Filter option and click on Save button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-transformation-filters.jpg"                      alt="vlc transformtation filters"                ></p><p>Step 6: Go to Media menu and click on Convert Save option.</p><p>Step 7: Under Open Media Box, click on Add button and then click on Convert&#x2F;Save button.</p><p>Step 8: Under Convert Window, select Convert radio button and select a video output format.

Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone.

These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools.

These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular.

A layer can be described as any type of image, moving or still, that is superimposed over a background image. However, just adding one layer over another will not create a strong visual impact on the spectator, which is why using Blending Modes is recommended if you want to <strong>blend two overlaying videos or images</strong> seamlessly.</p><p>It is a widely accepted opinion that Blend Modes can only be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects, but in this article, we are going to bust that myth and show you how to utilize Blending Modes in Filmora Scrn. Before we get started, let’s figure out what blending modes is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora"><a href="#What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What are Blending Modes in Filmora?"></a>What are Blending Modes in Filmora?</h2><p>Combining videos or images into a single frame is an art that is much older than digital pictures, so when trying to understand Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn it is best to try to visualize two pieces of celluloid film, one over another. Two pieces of film are transparent, but the images they contain do not mix with each other, that is why when you are using Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn you are actually merging videos and allowing their pixels to mix.</p><p>Different ways of combining pixels are called modes, and for that reason, the properties of the <strong>Linear Burn mode</strong> are not the same as the properties of the <strong>Multiply blending mode</strong>. Each mode you select, brings preset image transparency as well as brightness, contrast and color values. Which mode you will use depends mostly on the context and the images you want to use in your video.</p><p>The <strong>Normal mode</strong> is a part of the standard set of blending modes in almost all photo and video editing programs. It enables you to keep the top layer intact, by preventing the pixels from two images to merge. It is a perfect PIP blending mode since it allows you to keep two overlaying images separate and have two different narratives within the same shot. Producers of YouTube videos and tutorials of any kind or gamers who want to entertain their audiences should use the Normal mode when editing their footage captured with Filmora Scrn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-normal-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770544">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770544">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770544%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770544/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The <strong>Screen Mode</strong> is best used when you are working with dark monochrome backgrounds because it reduces the dark areas in the video thus enabling you to blend the top layer into the background seamlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-screen-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>Utilizing this mode successfully requires previous preparation because the effects you’ll get if you use the Screen mode with a footage that is not best suited for this mode are far from impressive. Therefore, the video clips you want to overlay and blend with each other must be recorded perfectly in order to get the best results.</p><p>The <strong>Multiply Mode</strong> is also one of the frequently used blending modes that <strong>multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the overlaying video clip</strong> with a matching pixel from the background video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-multiply-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>This mode will enable you to create the black background for your video effortlessly, and highlight the subjects in the video clip you intend to use as a top layer. You need to choose carefully which video clips you are going to use and how are they going to look on a dark background if you want to produce visually pleasing videos that captivate the viewer’s attention.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144289/7443" target="_top" id="2144289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144289/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-use-Blending-Modes"><a href="#How-to-use-Blending-Modes" class="headerlink" title="How to use Blending Modes?"></a>How to use Blending Modes?</h2><p>Applying different blending modes and switching between them is easy, and it won’t take more than a few minutes of your time, once you get a hold of it. Filmora Scrn features a number of different blending modes, so figuring out what each mode can do may take some time and practice. Let’s have a look at how you can add multiple layers to your videos and how to use blending modes.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-files-into-Filmora-Scrn"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-files-into-Filmora-Scrn" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Importing files into Filmora Scrn"></a>Step 1 - Importing files into Filmora Scrn</h4><p>In case you’ve used Filmora Scrn’s screen recorder to capture your video, the video clip will be opened in the software’s video editor and placed in the media bin, immediately after the recording session is over.

None, however, have been stretched as far as roguelikes and roguelites. You’ve probably heard these terms used to describe recent hit games such as <em>Hades</em>, <em>Dead Cells,</em> and <em>Binding of Isaac</em> and have wondered if there’s a difference. While both of these game types share a lot of common elements and the lines between them are seemingly blurred, there is a clear distinction between roguelikes and roguelites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/isaac-poster.jpg"                      alt="isaac-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>This article contains:</strong></p><hr><p>Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</p><hr><h3 id="Rogue-Where-it-all-started"><a href="#Rogue-Where-it-all-started" class="headerlink" title="Rogue: Where it all started"></a>Rogue: Where it all started</h3><p>In order to best understand these two game genres, we must first analyze the origin of their namesakes. Way back in 1980, game designers Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman released an ASCII art dungeon crawler called <em>Rogue</em>. Inspired by the pen-and-paper RPG <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, this turn-based adventure game had players explore dungeons in which they fought monsters and gathered items to help them power up their characters. The game’s defining mechanic was <strong>permadeath</strong>. This meant that once your character died, it was literally the end. You couldn’t create a save nor revive your fallen hero in any way. Starting over meant a completely fresh game with a brand new character. What’s more is that starting a new game meant the dungeons were completely different, including enemy placement, room location, and item distribution. Every decision could mean either living and carrying on or dying and starting over, making the choices players made meaningful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/michael-toy-glenn-wichman.jpg"                      alt="michael-toy-glenn-wichman"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelike-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelike-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelike Game?"></a>What is a Roguelike Game?</h2><p>As the name implies, a roguelike - or roguelike - is a game that shares the same mechanics that defined <em>Rogue</em>. They have procedurally generated environments, making every playthrough feel completely fresh and different. Dying in a roguelike means all progress is lost, and you need to start over, no saves, no lives, no ifs nor buts. It’s at this juncture where some debate exists as to what truly defines a roguelike. There are fans out there who’ll tell you that a roguelike must not only share the mechanics but also the game’s layout and combat system. According to them, since <em>Rogue</em> was a top-down third-person turn-based RPG that played on a grid, all true roguelikes should then play and look the same. The other camp sees roguelikes as purely defined by true permadeath with some leniency afforded with regards to less important elements such as player perspective, combat systems, and screen orientation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rogue-poster.jpg"                      alt="rogue-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134218/18498" target="_top" id="2134218">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134218" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134218/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelite-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelite-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelite Game?"></a>What is a Roguelite Game?</h2><p>Roguelites - or rogue-lites - in essence, employ a lighter approach to implementing <em>Rogue</em>‘s key characteristics. For the most part, roguelites still have permadeath. If you die, then you have to start over. However, the <strong>key difference</strong> is that roguelites allow you to carry over some form of progress from one playthrough to the next. Depending on the game, the way progress is carried over varies. Some games allow you to unlock additional items that can drop in a given run. Others open up access to new areas or provide you with abilities that enable you to traverse towards new locations and expand your area of exploration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-hades.jpg"                      alt="unlock-hades"                ></p><p>Roguelites also have procedurally generated environments in a lot of cases. There are titles that have completely random level layouts and enemy placements. Others draw from a pre-defined set of layouts that are mixed and matched. Some titles may simply randomize more minute elements such as item placement and the locations of points of interest. Another way roguelites differ in the way they handle procedural generation is through seeded runs. A seed is essentially a run with pre-determined parameters, including enemy types and placements, level layout, and item availability. Seeding is also used to generate special challenge runs as well as enable custom modes. Whatever the case, roguelites have a tendency to reign in the chaos of fully procedurally generated game content.</p><p>It’s roguelites that are also usually a mix of different genres with <em>Rogue</em> style mechanics. From action RPGs to card games, the roguelite genre’s offerings are quite expansive. The leniency they give when it comes to permadeath and randomness affords developers more design space in which they can craft unique experiences.</p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151883/7443" target="_top" id="2151883">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151883" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151883/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-Clear-Distinction"><a href="#A-Clear-Distinction" class="headerlink" title="A Clear Distinction"></a>A Clear Distinction</h2><p>Regardless of where you stand on what defines a faithful roguelike, the distinction between it and roguelites is quite straightforward. You know you are playing a roguelike when dying means you <strong>lose it all</strong>. No matter how far into the game you’ve progressed, one misstep means all of the time and work you put into your progress has come to an end. Roguelites, on the other hand, prefer to give you <strong>some sense of progression</strong>, making them <strong>friendlier</strong> for players who don’t want to play with the stress of potentially losing everything.</p><p>There’s an argument to be made that roguelikes give you a truly unique experience each time while roguelites end up becoming grindy and repetitive. When every little decision you make can lead you to lose your character and progress, you become more focused on your run, rather than the game as a whole. You’re forced to play your best, scrutinize every possible choice, and make meaningful comparisons between items and gear you come across. The risk is higher when playing roguelikes, but the reward and payoff of making it far in a run are quite big.</p><p>If you were to conclude that roguelikes are for the <strong>hardest of core gamers</strong> and roguelites are more <strong>casual</strong> in nature, you would be quite close to the mark. A lot of roguelite titles, however, have difficulty settings that can turn them into absolutely brutal experiences, rendering progress and unlocks less important than the player’s overall skill.</p><hr><p>Part 2: Examples of Roguelike and Roguelite Titles</p><p>If you’ve been meaning to dive into either or both of these genres, we’ve got a few titles for you to check out.</p><p><strong>You might also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Roguelike or Roguelite Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelike-Games"><a href="#Roguelike-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelike Games"></a>Roguelike Games</h3><p>For this list, we’re using the “true” definition of roguelike, meaning games that are almost exactly like <em>Rogue</em>.</p><h4 id="Nethack"><a href="#Nethack" class="headerlink" title="Nethack"></a>Nethack</h4><p><em>Nethack</em> is considered one of the most important roguelikes as it is as close to <em>Rogue</em> as a game can get. Apart from permadeath and procedurally generated environments, it shares a lot of <em>Rogue’s</em> core attributes, including the ASCII art style and screen layout. Compared to <em>Rogue</em>, <em>Nethack</em> has a much larger collection of enemies and items, making exploring its world more rewarding. <em>Nethack</em> also includes “conducts” which are special limitations players can choose to impose upon themselves in order to make the game even more challenging.</p><h4 id="Caves-of-Qud"><a href="#Caves-of-Qud" class="headerlink" title="Caves of Qud"></a>Caves of Qud</h4><p>Straying a bit from <em>Rogue’s</em> high fantasy setting, <em>Caves of Qud</em> mixes some science fiction into its world. Just like <em>Rogue</em>, dying means your progress goes caput. Environments, however, are only partially generated randomly, with some elements being pre-defined. The game also includes a robust mutation system to power up your character as well as quests and side-quests which you can choose to follow or ignore. On top of all this, <em>Caves of Qud</em> adds another layer of randomness through its procedurally generated political systems.</p><h4 id="Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup"><a href="#Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup" class="headerlink" title="Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</h4><p>Recognized as one of the best roguelikes of all time, <em>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</em> is one of the true innovators of its space. Taking all of the core defining elements of <em>Rogue</em>, including its hyper retro art style, <em>DCSS</em> makes a concerted effort towards being more accessible. For starters, it offers a more user-friendly interface that brings all important information to the forefront. The developers also wanted to make its gameplay far easier to understand so that any person can pick it up and play without needing any convoluted prior knowledge of how the game works.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelite-Games"><a href="#Roguelite-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelite Games"></a>Roguelite Games</h3><p>For this genre, we’ve chosen three games that are completely different to illustrate the wider variety of titles that exists within the roguelite space.</p><h4 id="Dead-Cells"><a href="#Dead-Cells" class="headerlink" title="Dead Cells"></a>Dead Cells</h4><p><em>Dead Cells</em> is an exploration-based action platformer (a.k.a. a metroidvania) with roguelite elements. Just like all _Rogue_-based games, dying in <em>Dead Cells</em> means you start over from the beginning. However, not <strong>all progress</strong> is lost. As you progress through various biomes of the game, you’ll unlock new traversal abilities that allow you to access new biomes and pathways. While some randomness exists in each biome, it feels less like levels are procedurally generated and more like a mixing of pre-determined layout components. You’ll also stumble upon blueprints for items which you can then spend Cells you gather to make the items available to drop in future runs. By beating the game’s final boss you can unlock progressively harder difficulties, making the game increasingly more brutal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><h4 id="Slay-the-Spire"><a href="#Slay-the-Spire" class="headerlink" title="Slay the Spire"></a>Slay the Spire</h4><p>One of the most highly praised indie games, MegaCrit’s <em>Slay the Spire</em> is a shining example of a perfect blend of genres. It’s a deckbuilding card game where you must climb the titular Spire while defeating enemies and bosses in turn-based card battles, so you can ultimately slay its heart. Each run consists of 3 Acts, each of which gives you choices of pathways that are procedurally generated. While enemy placement is somewhat controlled at first, it becomes more truly random the higher you climb. What makes StS particularly challenging is that it affords very few options to restore health so guarding your HP is vital. While death does mean you’ll have to start all the way from the bottom, you can unlock new cards for each of the game’s 4 classes as you level them up. The game also offers a wide variety of options for challenges and seeded custom runs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036467/19272" target="_top" id="2036467">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036467" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036467/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Hades"><a href="#Hades" class="headerlink" title="Hades"></a>Hades</h4><p>Nominated for a Game of the Year award, <em>Hades</em> is a beloved title that has converted many gamers to the roguelite genre. Your aim in the game, as the son of Hades, is to escape the Ancient Greek hell and ascend to the top of Olympus with the rest of the pantheon. The gameplay is fast-paced action hack-and-slash but it’s in a top-down perspective which makes it feel a lot closer to <em>Rogue</em> than other games in the genre. It also has a lot of elements that are randomized, including the location of helpful shops. Your build will also feel wildly different between runs as even the Gods that appear to power you up are random as well as the abilities they offer you to choose from.</p><p><img
