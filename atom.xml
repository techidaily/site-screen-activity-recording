If you do not have a high-end computer, you are likely to face Encoding Overloaded issue while using OBS Studio. High encoding problem is rather common in OBS Studio because video recording and streaming demand high system resources which your computer is unable to meet.</p><p>In layman’s terms, encoding overloading means your hardware is just not running as fast as required to process the video you are streaming or recording. Since you cannot change your hardware configuration overnight, here are the different ways you can fix OBS high encoding when streaming.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution"><a href="#Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution"></a>Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution</h2><p>The higher the resolution of the video recording or streaming, the greater will be the CPU usage. This is because your processor has to process more number of pixels per frame. That is why you have to lower the output resolution of your video. Even when your base resolution is high, you have to cut down the output resolution. Base resolution is the resolution of the video at source which could be the game you are playing. The output resolution is the resolution of the video you are getting after recording or you are streaming in real-time. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will have to look for Output (Scaled) Resolution option.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce the resolution from the current resolution. If it is at 1920 x 1080p, you have to bring it down to 1280 x 720p.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok buttons. Restart your computer and start streaming or recording again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate"></a>Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate</h2><p>The frame rate of a video determines the number of frames captured per second. The higher the frame rate, the greater will be the pressure on GPU to render more number of frames per second. Unless you have a powerful configuration, you will come across OBS high encoding when streaming if the frame rate is high such as 60FPS. Here are the steps to lower the frame rate of your video on OBS.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Video tab and look for Common FPS Values option.</p><p>Step 3: If it is set to 60, you have to bring it down to 30. Basically, you have to reduce the current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the new setting. Restart your computer and resume your OBS operation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-apply-and-ok-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on apply and ok button"                ></p><h2 id="Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset"><a href="#Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Change Encoder Preset"></a>Way 3. Change Encoder Preset</h2><p>By default, OBS uses x264 as encoder and the encoder preset is set to “veryfast”. This is generally the best and most balanced setting. However, if you are getting OBS high encoding warning, you have to change the encoder preset to reduce the CPU usage. Generally, the higher the preset, the lower is CPU usage. Therefore, you have to set the preset from “veryfast” to “ultrafast” and here are the steps.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and make sure that the encoder is Software(x264).</p><p>Step 3: Turn on Enable Advanced Encoder Settings option.</p><p>Step 4: Change the Encoder Preset from Veryfast to Ultrafast.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button. Restart your computer and perform your action on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-encoder-preset.jpg"                      alt="obs change encoder preset"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding"><a href="#Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding"></a>Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding</h2><p>You can try out different hardware encoders available such as Quicksync, AMF, or NVENC. The availability of different hardware encoders depends on your computer hardware configuration. These hardware encoders are better than the default x264 encoder as they use less CPU resources. Since the issue is primarily with encoder, you should try changing the encoder and see if the problem is fixed.</p><p>Step 1: On OBS, you will have to go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Output tab and set Output Mode to Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Streaming tab, and check all the encoders available.</p><p>Step 4: Change the encoder from default x264 to any other hardware encoder available.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok to save the settings. Restart your computer and perform your operation on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-restart-your-computer-and-perform-your-operation.jpg"                      alt="obs restart your computer and perform your operation"                ></p><h2 id="Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings"><a href="#Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings"></a>Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings</h2><p>If you are still facing OBS high encoding problem, you need to change some advanced settings in order to fix this encoder overloaded issue. You can change the keyframe interval so that your processor gets enough time for rendering. Similarly, you can change Rate Control from Constant to Variable so that the video does not demand high bandwidth.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and set Output Mode as Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: From Streaming tab, change Keyframe Interval and set it to 2 from zero.</p><p>Step 4: Change Rate Control from CBR to VBR.</p><p>Step 5: Change Profile from None to Main.</p><p>Step 6: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the changes. Restart your computer and check if the problem is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-open-and-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs open and go to settings"                ></p><h2 id="Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative"><a href="#Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Way 6. Use OBS Alternative"></a>Way 6. Use OBS Alternative</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned ways can solve the constant encoding overloaded warning you are receiving while using OBS Studio for recording or streaming, you have to opt for an alternative. Wondershare Filmora is the best alternative to OBS for recording screen and webcam. Filmora does not affect the CPU performance as significantly as OBS Studio does.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Essential-Tips-Recording-Every-Moment-of-Skype-on-OBS"><a href="#Essential-Tips-Recording-Every-Moment-of-Skype-on-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Essential Tips: Recording Every Moment of Skype on OBS"></a>Essential Tips: Recording Every Moment of Skype on OBS</h2><p>Video interviews for remote jobs are quite common these days because of this quickening pace of the world around us. And these interviews are recorded to further evaluate the information exchanged, so for the recording of these videos certain tools have also been introduced in the market. I myself have used a few of them; and the most popular these days are easily zoom and skype. Both these programs offer clear communication among all concerned parties. The reason why I want to discuss skype here is that zoom’s video quality is an issue, it has got very low video quality and the audio, it records in one track so if you have made a mistake in the speaking or something audible, it will remain there.</p><p>So in this article I will discuss that how can you record your skype videos using OBS. Skype has been extensively used for quite a long time now and it hasn’t lost its edge over the years but has actually upgraded and improved its services with time. Coming to OBS which is an open-source software used widely for streaming purposes. It provides an incredible experience courtesy of its variety of editing and recording options. The audio can be recorded from the system and the microphone. And video can be fetched from the webcam. Along with the recording of specific section of the screen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS"></a>Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS</h2><p>To begin with shedding some light on the OBS program:</p><p>A little piece of software that can be used for both business and non-commercial purposes. Streaming on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook is supported. It has the ability to record the screen with cursor effects. It allows you to record your screen indefinitely. Watermarks aren’t added: the video doesn’t have any watermarks. There are options for multichannel, Multilanguage, and single channel.</p><p>Now to setup the environment for screen recording we have to follow the following steps.</p><p>Initially, you’ll be required to have skype installed on your desktop along with the up-to-date version of OBS software. After installing skype you first have to make a secondary&#x2F;backup account on skype. After that you require a secondary camera as well to record yourself because your webcam can be in demand elsewhere, so you would not be able to record yourself or even the guests wouldn’t be able to see you. And then turn on the given command in skype i-e: skype&gt;settings&gt;calling&gt;advanced&gt;’allow NDI usage’ as shown in the picture. This command allows OBS to access skype videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-calling-settings-advanced-calling.jpg"                      alt="skype calling settings advanced calling"                ></p><p>After this you have to open the OBS program and set it up for skype calls, firs thing is to create a new scene, then you’re going to hit the plus button and select the capture device. Now you can see yourself on camera and screen can easily be cropped, while holding ‘Alt’, on OBS so fix it according to your liking.

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere4"                ></p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Creating such amazing things and sharing them on your social media and video sharing platforms can get you a lot of audience and views.

They can look stunning, particularly on the PS5 and Xbox Series X, and they can overwhelm with interesting new twists on the tried-and-true shooter concept. They often put us against brainy villains and those who wish to devour them. And they never fail to wow with their speed and flair.</p><p>While talking about Best Fps Games’ first-person shooters are one of the most popular game genres, picking the top 30 examples is difficult. We need a set of laws, but even then, another ten are killed by a headshot for every gunman who makes it through. On this list, we’ll look at games with first-person shooting as their main mechanic. In 2021, the game should be playable right now. Multiplayer FPS and first-person battle royales are hot, while first-person action RPGs like Fallout 4 and action-adventure games like Deathloop are out and known as best Fps games. These are the guidelines. Shooting the messenger isn’t a good idea.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the 7 best Fps games available right now.</p><h3 id="1-BLACK-MESA"><a href="#1-BLACK-MESA" class="headerlink" title="1.BLACK MESA"></a>1.BLACK MESA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/black-mesa-poster.jpg"                      alt="black-mesa-poster"                ></p><p>Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine. Black Mesa took 15 years to achieve version 1.0, but it’s well worth waiting when it was released in 2020. To offer a more condensed experience, the remake is a revised version of the classic single-player campaign, with no outdated puzzles or battle sequences. The crew also created an enhanced version of Alien planet Xen, ostensibly cut from Half-Life 1’s last chapter.</p><p>Although there’s no denying the Half-Life 1 is just a great game, particularly in light of what it achieved for PC gaming, its gameplay isn’t without flaws, which are addressed in Black Mesa. Black Mesa is the greatest way to see what you’ve been losing out on if you haven’t experienced the original Half-Life game.

Not only are there over 60 weapons in Escape from Tarkov, but each one may be modified or stripped down to the point of being unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents. For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds.

Thus, popular video-conferencing platforms allow users to add filters, effects, and masks, and Google meet is no different. So, you can adorn your video call with these fun features no matter you are using an Android or iOS device. Google Meet features a vast collection of filters and masks that you can use to hide your face. Plus, you can also use these features to give the video session an entertaining touch.

However, Google Meet does not allow all accounts to use filters and mask in the same way. To cut the story short, some of the masks and filters might be accessible with workspace, while others are only usable through your personal Gmail accounts. Workplace place accounts need to be professional with limited filters and effects available for them. If you want to know the requirements for using filters and effects on specific devices and different accounts, the following section will discuss them in detail.</p><ul><li><strong>Account</strong></li></ul><p>Using your personal account rather than the workplace account is better to use maximum filters, effects, and masks. Duo-style filters, AR masks, to name a few, are features that can be easily applied when using Google Meet through personal accounts.</p><ul><li><strong>Operating system</strong></li></ul><p>Some visual filters and masks are only to be enjoyed when you join video sessions through Android and iOS apps. This means you may not be able to access them through internet browsers.</p><ul><li><strong>Participation in a video call</strong></li></ul><p>To use filters and effects, you must be a participant in the Google Meet session. So, you must log in preferably through your personal Gmail account to enjoy unlimited filters, effects, and masks.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?</h2><p>Google Meet lets you add filters, effects, and masks to make a video call a fun-filled activity. Effects fall in a broader domain. In short, there exist few different categories in effects, including filters, styles, background, and masks. Plus, they are also completely different. Effects are used to enhance the video by adding unique transitions such as fading and other visual effects. On the other hand, filters improve your look by adding different frames and designs in a video. Last but not least, masks add funky faces and covers to your face.</p><p>Are you interested in mastering the art of adding filters, effects, and masks?
