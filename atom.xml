Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:</p><ul><li>Xbox one</li><li>PlayStation Vita</li><li>iOS</li><li>Android</li><li>MacOS</li><li>Linux, and even;</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul><p>Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit. If you never knew, Stardew Valley Ginger Island is filled with fun activities as well as puzzles.</p><h2 id="Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>It must be clearly stated that Stardew Valley Ginger Island is where the majority of the new content of Stardew Valley takes place.

For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward.

To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ultimate-Low-Cost-Gaming-Setups-Keyboard-Picks"><a href="#Ultimate-Low-Cost-Gaming-Setups-Keyboard-Picks" class="headerlink" title="Ultimate Low-Cost Gaming Setups: Keyboard Picks"></a>Ultimate Low-Cost Gaming Setups: Keyboard Picks</h2><p>Are you looking for the best gaming keyboard under 100$? Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But don’t be concerned! So you don’t have to break the bank, we’ve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money — somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldn’t suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference — from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we can’t begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons. It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. They’re a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they don’t provide the same haptic feedback, and they’re still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>It’s jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side. It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest. Thus it shouldn’t be too tiring to use for extended gaming sessions.</p><h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Its keys are very quiet</p><p>finest gaming keyboard with non-mechanical keys</p><h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Its typing quality is low</p><p>The ABS keycaps are slick and unstable, which leads to inadvertent key presses</p><h3 id="2-EVGA-Z12"><a href="#2-EVGA-Z12" class="headerlink" title="2.EVGA Z12"></a>2.EVGA Z12</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/evga-z12.png"                      alt="evga-z12"                ></p><p>Look at the EVGA Z12 if you want something even cheaper. The unique EVGA Waterproof rubber dome buttons are lighter to push than Corsair RBG K55 PRO XT. Therefore gaming isn’t as responsive. They have a smaller pre-travel distance, which means they type more accurately. This is a good option if you are searching for the best gaming keyboard under 100$.</p><h5 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Five macro keys and each one is reprogrammed.</p><p>Separate media buttons.</p><p>Full-size keyboard.</p><h5 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>It is zone-lit rather than RGB.</p><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory.</p><p>Gaming isn’t as responsive.</p><h3 id="3-G413-Logitech"><a href="#3-G413-Logitech" class="headerlink" title="3.G413 Logitech"></a>3.G413 Logitech</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/g413-logitech.png"                      alt="g413-logitech"                ></p><p>A good keyboard with excellent gaming performance should appeal to the majority of entry-level gamers. We can say Logitech’s G413 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$. Despite its low price, it is well-made, with a plastic body and a strong metal top half so that you will have no problems with it.</p><p>Only patented Romer-G Tactile switches are included, which feature a short pre-travel distance and provide excellent tactile feedback without being too heavy to write on. ABS keycaps feel pleasant to touch and seem to be solid. Thus the keyboard provides excellent typing quality. It offers minimal latency for gamers. Therefore you won’t even notice any lag when playing. It features individually illuminated keys and illumination. However, it’s only offered in red.</p><h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Macros can be assigned to any of the function keys.</p><p>You can store your settings using the G HUB Logitech online sync feature if you wish to use them on a different computer.</p><p>The best inexpensive keyboard you can buy.</p><h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory</p><h3 id="4-Z15-EVGA"><a href="#4-Z15-EVGA" class="headerlink" title="4.Z15 EVGA"></a>4.Z15 EVGA</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/z15-evga.png"                      alt="z15-evga"                ></p><p>The EVGA Z15 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with mechanical keys that we’ve tested. It’s an excellent gaming keyboard featuring a few extra functions to enhance your gaming experience. It’s full-size, with a sturdy frame and superior quality finishing, but still, ABS keycaps aren’t as comfortable as PBT.</p><p>It comes with vertical Kailh Speed Silver and Kailh clicky Speed Bronze keys, both of which we tried, and it’s hot-swappable so that you can use anything you like. Our unit’s clicky ones feature a short pre-travel range and low operational force, making them easy to push for gaming. The delay is also quite common, thus there should be no noticeable lag when gaming. The EVGA Release RGB software allows you to remap all keys, but it isn’t as user-friendly as other rival manufacturers’ software.</p><h5 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Keyboard is best suited to gaming.</p><p>It’s a straightforward keyboard with excellent ergonomics and comfy wrist rest.</p><h5 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keys are too touchy for typing.</p><p>Keys can be noisy in a noisy setting.</p><h3 id="5-Corsair-K63"><a href="#5-Corsair-K63" class="headerlink" title="5.Corsair K63"></a>5.Corsair K63</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-k63.jpg"                      alt="corsair-k63"                ></p><p>Corsair K63 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with the wireless link we’ve tested. This mechanical TenKeyLess variant may connect to up to 2 different devices at the same time, either through the USB receiver or over Bluetooth. The ergonomics are excellent since it’s a horizontal keyboard with just one inclination option.

It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. They’re a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they don’t provide the same haptic feedback, and they’re still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>It’s jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side. It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest.

The unique EVGA Waterproof rubber dome buttons are lighter to push than Corsair RBG K55 PRO XT. Therefore gaming isn’t as responsive.

Yet, we use them day-in and day-out to show, explain, and communicate. Screenshots help us enrich and liven up our daily communication, whether it’s sharing an image of a software bug with customer support, sending a quick how-to GIF to a colleague, or writing a heartfelt joke to a loved one.</p><p>Many Mac users need a widely-rated, multi-use MacBook snipping tool. All Mac users should know how to use the snipping tools, especially sales representatives and customer service representatives who use screenshots for product demos and troubleshooting. The simplest way to share your screen on Mac is by taking a screenshot.</p><p>However, a Mac user must use a snipping tool to take pictures. Despite the popularity of the Windows Snipping Tool, Mac users have been wondering how to use it. The good news is that there are several snipping tools tailored to Mac’s system requirements. In this article, we will look at the list of some of the best snipping tools for MAC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Snagit"><a href="#1-Snagit" class="headerlink" title="1.Snagit"></a>1.Snagit</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snagit-for-mac.png"                      alt="snagit-for-mac"                ></p><p>As far as screen capturing software goes, Snagit is the gold standard. Due to its attractive interface and powerful features, it is very popular with corporate customers. Among its many features are screen recording and editing. An important aspect of the app is its intuitive user interface.</p><p>The top of your screen displays a small control panel. Screenshots can be taken, settings can be changed, and hotkeys customized. The editor provides several useful tools, including callouts, arrows, blur, and others. From the app, you can also create animated gifs and videos. The process of capturing and editing images and videos on a Mac is seamless that even the least tech-savvy user will find it easy to use.</p><p>There are several ways to capture your screen with Snagit. An entire screen can be captured, a specific area, or a specific application. Scanners and cameras can also be used to import images.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Fraps-Experience-for-Game-Capture"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Fraps-Experience-for-Game-Capture" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Fraps Experience for Game Capture"></a>The Ultimate Fraps Experience for Game Capture</h2><p>If you like to record video games, Fraps can help you take your YouTube channel to new heights. Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install"></a>1. Download and Install</h2><p>Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program’s full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings. Games that utilize OpenGL and DirectX technologies are compatible with the system.</p><p>DOWNLOAD LINK: <a class="link"   href="https://fraps.com/" >FRAPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps"><a href="#2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Record Screen with Fraps"></a>2. How to Record Screen with Fraps</h2><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> When you first launch Fraps, you’ll see that there isn’t much to it. There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS &gt; Benchmark Settings to your desire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg"                      alt="fps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest “X” seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movies.jpg"                      alt="movies"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.

After a picture is acquired, the platform automatically names and timestamps it. It also includes features for video files such as movie cursor hiding, stereoscopic 3D, and RGB capturing.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Fraps enable you to record high-quality DirectX or OpenGL games.</li><li>It enables you to see the number of frames per second (FPS) that you are receiving.</li><li>You may also snap a screenshot at any time interval using Fraps.</li><li>It enables you to record high-quality DirectX and OpenGL games.</li><li>It’s free to use for frame rate display and benchmarking, and it’s free to use for video capture with certain restrictions (30-second time limit).</li><li>It enables you to simultaneously record your games with computer sound and your voice.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Your computer screen, webcam, or face cam cannot be recorded.</li><li>The Microsoft Store does not enable you to record DirectX 12 or Windows games.</li><li>It is not possible to record the computer screen or webcam.</li><li>You can’t post a captured video to YouTube or Vimeo using it.</li><li>The Mac version of Fraps Screen Recorder is currently unavailable.</li></ul><h2 id="4-Best-Fraps-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Fraps-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4. Best Fraps Alternative"></a>4. Best Fraps Alternative</h2><p>One of its primary issues may have an impact on the game’s internal performance. When using Frap Screen Recorder to record, the quality of the recording degrades by roughly 13%. It may create lag and sluggish progress on their computer, and the reason for this may be due to the game’s high settings; thus, the game should be adjusted to the lowest level and played at a lower resolution. Fraps Screen Recorder does not fulfill your demands, which is one of the reasons you are seeking a solution. Yes, I see why. Fraps Screen Recorder is a unique screen recording application. Filmora Screen Recorder is another choice for Fraps Screen Recorder.

Games that allow you to progress quite effectively even without being active for an extended period are the best mobile idle games.</p><p>There is no limit to how many idle games you can play, and you can finish all your daily tasks in only minutes. It does not matter if you like to play Android RPGs, tycoon games, or whatnot. There are plenty of idle games out there for you to choose from.</p><p>In general, idle games fall into two categories: the true idle game, where you can leave your game running for hours but still gain progress (resources, levels, currency, etc. ), or the pseudo-idle game that claims to be idle. The latter category consists of idle clickers and the like, where progress is more likely to be made by tapping than simply being idle.</p><p>You need only know that idle games (if you find the right ones) can be delightful if you’re unfamiliar with either of them. Please let me give you a hand if you’re still in search!

The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better.

Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam"></a>Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam</h2><p>Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong></p><p>The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform.

About OBS Studio</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is popular for screen recording and live streaming. It is open-source software, and all the features are completely free to use. It is also a cross-platform software that you can use across all desktop operating systems. Apart from capturing screen, you can record video from webcam as well. In fact, it supports different external devices for capturing video including capture card for gaming consoles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>Besides, you can record video with audio from system as well as external sources. You can live stream on almost every platform using OBS which is why it is so popular among video creators. The software lets you customize all the settings for recording as per your requirements, and you can even edit the recording as per requirements. The only issue with OBS Studio is that its user interface is slightly complicated.</p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements -</strong></p><ul><li>Supported OS - Windows, Mac, Linux.</li><li>Processor - Dual-core processor or higher.</li><li>RAM - 2 GB or more.</li><li>HDD - 1 GB or more.</li><li>VGA - 800x600, 16 bit color.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-About-Bandicam-3"><a href="#Part-2-About-Bandicam-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. About Bandicam"></a>Part 2. About Bandicam</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is specially designed for Windows PC users. You can capture high-quality videos as well as retain the quality of the recordings. The advantage of using Bandicam is that it lets you capture video with more compression rate. It lets you record from external sources like PlayStation, webcam, and smartphones. You can even add voice along with the system sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bandicam-screen-recorder-for-pc.jpg"                      alt="bandicam screen recorder"                ></p><p>It allows real-time drawing while recording. Bandicam also lets you add your webcam while recording the screen. You can schedule your recording. You can make use of the green screen technique as well. Besides, you can perform the basic editing after recording. In comparison to OBS, it is a highly user-friendly interface for easy operation.</p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements</strong> <strong>-</strong></p><ul><li>Supported OS - Windows only.</li><li>Processor - Dual-core processor or higher.</li><li>RAM - 1 GB or more.</li><li>HDD - 1 GB or more</li><li>VGA - 800x600, 16 bit color.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam-3"><a href="#Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam"></a>Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam</h2><p>Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong></p><p>The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The Ken Burns effect involves slow-paced zoom and pan over a still image to evoke a sense of movement, so the audience believes that they are watching a video and not just a slide show of still photos. There are many editing tools that can help you add the Ken Burns effect to your video and Camtasia 9 is one of them.</p><p>One of the most positive impacts generated by the Camtasia Ken Burns effect is that it enables your still photos to be used in a video as though they were a part of it. The effect is not only easy to understand but also quite user-friendly to apply. That is why it is often used by beginners and amateur YouTubers and content creators to add flair to their videos.

Open a New Project &amp; Import Images</h4><p>The first step you need to take to add the Ken Burns effect to your video is to open a new project in Camtasia 9. The next thing you have to do is import the images you want to use and add them to the Media Bin. This will enable you to work on the images and add the Ken Burns effect.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Adding-Camtasia-Ken-Burns-Effect"><a href="#Step-2-Adding-Camtasia-Ken-Burns-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 2.

Set the duration to 30 seconds. Once you have done that, you need to position the play head at the end of the video. On the left side of the screen, there is a menu that allows you to choose animations. Ensure that your <strong>Zoom and Pan</strong> tab is visible and active.</p><p>The square you see in the Zoom-n-Pan tab should be dragged to the right, so it appears to be panning through the image while the photo moves toward the left. Here you will see a small arrow on track 1 on your timeline.</p><p>At this point, all you need to do is drag that particular arrow to the left, so it spreads across the length of your video. Play the preview by pressing the space bar, and you will see the Ken Burns effect in motion.</p><p>In Camtasia 9, you have the option to experiment with zooming and panning or both to create new styles of the Ken Burns effect. You will learn as you experiment and will be able to create some really interesting videos in the process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Apply-Ken-Burns-Effect-with-the-Best-Alternative-to-Camtasia-9-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Apply-Ken-Burns-Effect-with-the-Best-Alternative-to-Camtasia-9-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Apply Ken Burns Effect with the Best Alternative to Camtasia 9 - Wondershare Filmora"></a>Apply Ken Burns Effect with the Best Alternative to Camtasia 9 - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>If you are looking for the best alternative to Camtasia 9 that makes adding the Ken Burns effect and other video editing features much easier, then Wondershare Filmora should be on your list of considerations.
